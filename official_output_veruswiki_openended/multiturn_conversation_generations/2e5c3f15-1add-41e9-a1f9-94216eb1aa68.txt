    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    What are some of the advanced features of Verus, specifically related to querying
    fractional basket currencies and enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology,
    and how can they be used for various purposes such as arbitrage, investment discovery,
    and estate planning?


    **ANSWER:**

    Verus offers several advanced features that enable users to take advantage of
    its capabilities. Two such features are system-wide queries for fractional basket
    currencies and enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology.


    **System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies:**

    Verus allows for system-wide queries of fractional basket currencies through its
    RPC API, `getcurrencyconverters`. This API enables users to instantly query any
    full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that
    contain one or more reserve currencies. This feature enables wallets or applications
    to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies and determine
    which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity. Users can then
    convert at the best possible rates worldwide or select only better-than-market
    rates and arbitrage to earn.


    This feature can be used for various purposes such as:


    * Arbitrage: By querying the entire network of fractional currencies, users can
    identify opportunities for arbitrage and earn profits by converting currencies
    at favorable rates.

    * Investment discovery: The API enables users to discover new investment opportunities
    by identifying fractional currencies with high liquidity and favorable conversion
    rates.

    * Conversion bargain hunting: Users can use the API to find the best conversion
    rates for their currencies and convert at the most favorable rates.


    **Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology:**

    VerusIDs have been enhanced with Verus Vault technology, which extends the already
    groundbreaking features of VerusIDs to include an advanced time lock capability.
    This capability enables users to implement various use cases such as vesting,
    trusts, and protocols for theft-proofing funds, while still allowing for staking
    on locked funds. With Verus Vault technology, users can have peace of mind knowing
    that their funds, identity, and estate planning are protected from lost or stolen
    private keys.


    Some potential use cases of enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology include:


    * Estate planning: Users can use Verus Vault technology to create trusts and other
    estate planning mechanisms that ensure their assets are protected and transferred
    according to their wishes.

    * Theft-proofing funds: The advanced time lock capability enables users to create
    protocols that protect their funds from theft or loss, while still allowing for
    staking and other uses of their funds.

    * Vesting: Verus Vault technology can be used to create vesting schedules for
    employees, investors, or other stakeholders, ensuring that funds are released
    only according to pre-defined terms.


    Overall, these advanced features of Verus enable users to take advantage of its
    capabilities and use cases, providing a robust and secure platform for various
