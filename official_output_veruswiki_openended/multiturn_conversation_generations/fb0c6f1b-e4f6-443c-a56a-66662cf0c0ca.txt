    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    Which happen when I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    The errors

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When you run `./verusd` on a Linux distribution (such as Debian or Devuan) may
    be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default
    on your Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error
    messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    Here''s how to fix this problem by installing these dependencies:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

    What are VerusIDs, and what are some of their key benefits?


    **ANSWER:**

    VerusIDs are not just an ID system: they are a fully-functional blockchain protocol.
    Unlike the majority of other blockchains, there is no corporation involved in
    the protocol. VerusIDs offer benefits such as (but not limited to): transferring
    funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability,
    privacy, and power. Let''s walk through each of these benefits in more detail.


    **Transferring Funds:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and this
    behavior can be controlled by single or multi-sig addresses that are specified
    in the identity itself. The controller of the identity can change these controlling
    addresses, and if they do so, then all future spends of UTXOs sent to the VerusID
    will follow the updated spend conditions, and will be subject to the updated keys.


    **Quantum Resistance:** VerusIDs are resistent to attacks by quantum computers
    using known algorithms. This helps people using VerusIDs use the Verus platform
    securely, even in a potential future with quantum computers. In more technical
    terms, VerusIDs are "quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses" on the worldwide
    Verus network.


    **Revocability:** Every VerusID includes a revocation authority (defaults to the
    identity self). If another ID is the revocation authority, then it can be used
    to revoke the identity -- this creates a valid transaction that, once mined into
    the block, prevents the VerusID from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered
    by the recovery authority. This effectively freezes all of the funds in the VerusID,
    and may be useful in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.


    **Recoverability:** Just like with revocability, a recovery authority can be specified
    (also defaults to self). Recovery authorities can recover VerusIDs from revoked
    states, with the option to alter the ID''s primary authorities used to spend and
    sign.


    **Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that
    may be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. VerusIDs have a special
    storage area that holds information, known as a content map of key-value hashes.
    This content map is designed to work together with different apps and identity
    policies. With this feature, you can privately store facts about yourself and
    choose to prove them to others when needed (selectively-provable claims and attestations).
    This means you may pick and choose what parts of your identity to prove. This
    proving can be done in a quantum secure way using a quantum secure signature,
    when that technology becomes available.


    **Power:** VerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other IDs can
    be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary addresses
    (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter itself. Further
    security is added by the fact that the revocation authority (the power to revoke
    an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority itself. The same applies
    to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover a revoked address). Each
    of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may be their own identities, potentially
    being controlled themselves by multiple primary addresses.'

    How does Verus facilitate the creation and operation of new blockchains, and what
    features does it offer for launching and managing these blockchains?


    **ANSWER:**

    Verus provides a platform for creating and operating new blockchains, offering
    a range of features that enable seamless connectivity, flexibility, and scalability.
    Here''s a breakdown of how Verus facilitates the creation and operation of new
    blockchains and the features it offers:


    **Seamless Connectivity:**

    Verus allows new blockchains to operate independently, with all fees generated
    through cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool earned
    on the new blockchain. This means that there is no rent going back to the Verus
    blockchain, ensuring that the new blockchain is self-sustaining.


    **Blockchain-based Crowdfunding Currency Launches:**

    Verus offers a blockchain-based crowdfunding system for launching new currencies.
    This system allows for minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for
    dual launches (blockchain and bridge). Users can set required minimum levels of
    worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimums
    are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically
    receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, minus network fees.


    **Launch Options:**

    The launch options provided by Verus include features such as:


    * Maximum participation in one or more currencies

    * Pre-launch discounts

    * Price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve
    ratio to issue currencies

    * Price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds

    * Pre-launch discounts for early participants

    * Vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs


    **Interoperable, Multichain Network:**

    Verus enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains
    in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized
    blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This allows for public blockchains to
    be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains
    that are easy to set up with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization
    and onto their internal private network and back.


    **Unlimited Scale:**

    There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and
    interoperate on the Verus network. While there may be some overhead for cross-notarization,
    the Verus blockchain network model enables unlimited scale and flexibility.


    In summary, Verus provides a comprehensive platform for creating and operating
    new blockchains, offering features such as seamless connectivity, blockchain-based
    crowdfunding, flexible launch options, and an interoperable, multichain network
    with unlimited scale.'
