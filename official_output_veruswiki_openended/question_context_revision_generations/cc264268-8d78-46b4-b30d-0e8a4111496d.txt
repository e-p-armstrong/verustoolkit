- content: 'You are checking whether a provided question and answer make sense if
    asked by themselves, with no additional information. You need to check for vague
    wording that a reader cannot interpret correctly, and questions that lack key
    context and would not be possibly answerable even if asked of someone with complete,
    masterful knowledge of the general subject matter of the question.


    In particular, you are checking for references to a "text" that is not provided,
    and you''re also hunting for anchor links to other information on the same document
    (such as)[#!/this/kind/of/thing.md], which will be broken links if they appear
    in the question or answer. Links that are URLs (external links) are fine, however.


    Evaluate the provided question-answer pair step-by-step. Following this, at the
    very end of your response, your "final judgment" or "final answer", you will write
    "PASS" or "FAIL" or "REWORD". A test should "PASS" if it "makes sense" and does
    not lack key context; it is a "FAIL" if it lacks key context, AND the question
    is not specific or clear. If it lacks context but the question is specific, pointed,
    and grounded, then it needs to be reworded to have the context-needing terms (i.e.,
    vague reference to "the text") removed. If it has no problems, it passes.


    The question may be part of a sequence of questions, so REFERENCES TO PREVIOUS
    STEPS ARE OK. It''s references to a text, or relative links, that are problems
    in need of fixing.


    If you decide to reword the question and answer, you MUST WRITE THE REWORDED QUESTION
    BELOW YOUR JUDGEMENT after the heading ### Question Rewording:


    I want you to especially check for vague references to "the text", "passage",
    and "excerpt". The question and answer should not mention unspecified, vague texts
    or excerpts.


    Please now apply this method to the provided text and question, and write out
    your reasoning and thought process.


    The goal with rewording is to have both the question and answer express a topic,
    fact, idea, or opinion in a GENERAL way that is NOT TIED TO ANY SPECIFIC CONTEXT
    which the reader does not have.

    What is the purpose of the steps outlined in the text, and what problem do they
    help to solve?



    **ANSWER:**


    The steps outlined in the text are designed to help resolve a situation where

    a Verus node''s blockchain has diverged from the correct chain, and the node is
    no longer in sync with the rest of the network. The steps allow the user to identify
    the earliest block that is causing the divergence, invalidate that block, and
    then resynchronize the node with the correct chain.

    ### Question Context Validation

    #### Special Term Context Check: specifically check for use of the terms "the
    text", "passage", and "excerpt". This question asks about "the text" without providing
    any context about the contents of this text.

    #### Scope and Precision: The question asks about "the steps outlined in the text",
    without specifying which steps are being considered, making this a vague question
    that lacks the context to be answers. Thus, this question fails this step.


    ### Answer Context Validation:

    #### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "the
    text", "passage", and "excerpt". This answer references "the text" without being
    clear about what "the text" is.

    #### Answer-Only Context Issues: Confirm that the answer does not introduce new
    and vague context that the question does not. The answer mentions "the text",
    but this was already introduced by the question. The question''s doing so was
    flawed, but the answer still does not introduce new, vague context that the question
    does not. So this passes.

    #### Answer Anchor Link Check: The answer does not use any anchor links.


    ### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:

    #### Evaluation: Some checks related to the question or answer failed. So this
    question and answer should be reworded if they can be, or fail otherwise. The
    question (and the answer) both lack context in mentioning *which* "text" they
    refer to, and what its contents are. However, I do not know what text the question
    is referring to, so I can''t add this information. The question without reference
    to a specific text would be "What is the purpose of the steps, and what problem
    do they help to solve?" which is too broad and does not make sense. I cannot fix
    this by rewording it. Therefore, this fails.

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the

    What are the different ways to send and convert currencies using the `sendcurrency`
    API in Verus, and what are the parameters used in each case?


    **ANSWER:**


    The `sendcurrency` API in Verus provides a versatile way to send and convert funds
    between different currencies and chains. Here are the different ways to use the
    `sendcurrency` API, along with the parameters used in each case:


    **Sending VRSCTEST to a Single Recipient:**

    You can send VRSCTEST from a single address to another single address using the
    `sendcurrency` API. The parameters used are:

    - `sender`: The address of the sender (e.g., `bob@`).

    - `recipient`: The address of the recipient (e.g., `alice@`).

    - `currency`: The currency being sent (e.g., `vrsctest`).

    - `amount`: The amount of currency being sent (e.g., `10`).


    Example: `verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "bob@" ''[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@","amount":10}]''`


    **Sending VRSCTEST from All Private Wallet Funds:**

    You can send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients using
    the `sendcurrency` API. The parameters used are:

    - `sender`: The wildcard `*Z` to indicate all private wallet funds.

    - `recipients`: An array of recipient addresses with friendly-name z-addresses
    (e.g., `alice@:private` and `bob@:private`).

    - `currency`: The currency being sent (e.g., `vrsctest`).

    - `amount`: The amount of currency being sent to each recipient (e.g., `10`).


    Example: `verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*Z" ''[{"currency":"vrsctest","address":"alice@:private","amount":10},{"currency":"VRSCTEST","address":"bob@:private","amount":10}]''`


    **Converting VRSCTEST to a Fractional Basket Currency:**

    You can convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency using the `sendcurrency`
    API. The parameters used are:

    - `sender`: The wildcard `*i` to indicate IDs as a funding source.

    - `recipient`: The address of the recipient (e.g., `bob@`).

    - `amount`: The amount of currency being converted (e.g., `10`).

    - `convertto`: The currency being converted to (e.g., `VRSC-BTC`).


    Example: `verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*i" ''[{"address":"bob@","amount":10,
    "convertto":"VRSC-BTC"}]''`


    **Converting VRSCTEST to Another Reserve:**

    You can convert VRSCTEST to another reserve through a fractional currency using
    the `sendcurrency` API. The parameters used are:

    - `sender`: The wildcard `*` to indicate all funds.

    - `recipient`: The address of the recipient (e.g., `bob@`).

    - `amount`: The amount of currency being converted (e.g., `10`).

    - `convertto`: The currency being converted to (e.g., `BTC`).

    - `via`: The fractional currency being used for the conversion (e.g., `VRSC-BTC`).


    Example: `verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"bob@","amount":10,
    "convertto":"BTC","via":"VRSC-BTC"}]''`


    **Preconverting to a New Currency:**

    You can preconvert VRSCTEST to a new currency before it is active using the `sendcurrency`
    API. The parameters used are:

    - `sender`: The wildcard `*` to indicate all funds.

    - `recipient`: The address of the recipient (e.g., `alice@`).

    - `amount`: The amount of currency being converted (e.g., `10`).

    - `convertto`: The new currency being converted to (e.g., `NEWCOIN`).

    - `preconvert`: A boolean indicating that the conversion should be preconverted
    (e.g., `true`).

    - `refundto`: The address to refund the original currency to if the conversion
    fails (e.g., `alice@`).


    Example: `verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"alice@","amount":10,
    "convertto":"NEWCOIN", "preconvert":true, "refundto":"alice@"}]''`


    **Sending and Converting VRSCTEST Cross-Chain:**

    You can send and convert VRSCTEST cross-chain to another chain, such as PBaaSChain,
    using the `sendcurrency` API. The parameters used are:

    - `sender`: The wildcard `*` to indicate all funds.

    - `recipient`: The address of the recipient on the other chain (e.g., `RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv`).

    - `amount`: The amount of currency being sent (e.g., `10`).

    - `exportto`: The name of the chain being exported to (e.g., `Bridge.PBaaSChain`).

    - `convertto`: The currency being converted to on the other chain (e.g., `PBaaSChain`).

    - `via`: The fractional currency being used for the conversion (e.g., `Bridge.PBaaSChain`).


    Examples:

    ```json

    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10,
    "exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]''

    verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency "*" ''[{"address":"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv","amount":10,
    "convertto":"PBaaSChain","exportto":"Bridge.PBaaSChain","via":"Bridge.PBaaSChain"}]''

    ```

    These are the different ways to send and convert currencies using the `sendcurrency`
    API in Verus. The parameters used in each case determine the specifics of the
    transaction, such as the sender, recipient, currency, amount, and conversion parameters.
