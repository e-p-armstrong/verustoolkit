- content: 'You are checking whether a provided question and answer make sense if
    asked by themselves, with no additional information. You need to check for vague
    wording that a reader cannot interpret correctly, and questions that lack key
    context and would not be possibly answerable even if asked of someone with complete,
    masterful knowledge of the general subject matter of the question.


    In particular, you are checking for references to a "text" that is not provided,
    and you''re also hunting for anchor links to other information on the same document
    (such as)[#!/this/kind/of/thing.md], which will be broken links if they appear
    in the question or answer. Links that are URLs (external links) are fine, however.


    Evaluate the provided question-answer pair step-by-step. Following this, at the
    very end of your response, your "final judgment" or "final answer", you will write
    "PASS" or "FAIL" or "REWORD". A test should "PASS" if it "makes sense" and does
    not lack key context; it is a "FAIL" if it lacks key context, AND the question
    is not specific or clear. If it lacks context but the question is specific, pointed,
    and grounded, then it needs to be reworded to have the context-needing terms (i.e.,
    vague reference to "the text") removed. If it has no problems, it passes.


    The question may be part of a sequence of questions, so REFERENCES TO PREVIOUS
    STEPS ARE OK. It''s references to a text, or relative links, that are problems
    in need of fixing.


    If you decide to reword the question and answer, you MUST WRITE THE REWORDED QUESTION
    BELOW YOUR JUDGEMENT after the heading ### Question Rewording:


    I want you to especially check for vague references to "the text", "passage",
    and "excerpt". The question and answer should not mention unspecified, vague texts
    or excerpts.


    Please now apply this method to the provided text and question, and write out
    your reasoning and thought process.


    The goal with rewording is to have both the question and answer express a topic,
    fact, idea, or opinion in a GENERAL way that is NOT TIED TO ANY SPECIFIC CONTEXT
    which the reader does not have.

    What is the purpose of the steps outlined in the text, and what problem do they
    help to solve?



    **ANSWER:**


    The steps outlined in the text are designed to help resolve a situation where

    a Verus node''s blockchain has diverged from the correct chain, and the node is
    no longer in sync with the rest of the network. The steps allow the user to identify
    the earliest block that is causing the divergence, invalidate that block, and
    then resynchronize the node with the correct chain.

    ### Question Context Validation

    #### Special Term Context Check: specifically check for use of the terms "the
    text", "passage", and "excerpt". This question asks about "the text" without providing
    any context about the contents of this text.

    #### Scope and Precision: The question asks about "the steps outlined in the text",
    without specifying which steps are being considered, making this a vague question
    that lacks the context to be answers. Thus, this question fails this step.


    ### Answer Context Validation:

    #### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "the
    text", "passage", and "excerpt". This answer references "the text" without being
    clear about what "the text" is.

    #### Answer-Only Context Issues: Confirm that the answer does not introduce new
    and vague context that the question does not. The answer mentions "the text",
    but this was already introduced by the question. The question''s doing so was
    flawed, but the answer still does not introduce new, vague context that the question
    does not. So this passes.

    #### Answer Anchor Link Check: The answer does not use any anchor links.


    ### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:

    #### Evaluation: Some checks related to the question or answer failed. So this
    question and answer should be reworded if they can be, or fail otherwise. The
    question (and the answer) both lack context in mentioning *which* "text" they
    refer to, and what its contents are. However, I do not know what text the question
    is referring to, so I can''t add this information. The question without reference
    to a specific text would be "What is the purpose of the steps, and what problem
    do they help to solve?" which is too broad and does not make sense. I cannot fix
    this by rewording it. Therefore, this fails.

    follow these steps:


    1. Quit your Wallet.

    2. Eject the wallet dmg.

    3. Make a backup of `wallet.dat` & `VRSC.conf` if necessary.

    4. If you installed the `Agama.app` in Applications, move it to the trash.

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.

    What are the requirements and options for creating a currency on a Verus blockchain,
    and how do these options affect the behavior of the currency?


    **ANSWER:**


    To create a currency on a Verus blockchain, the identity it is named after must
    be minted on the same blockchain. This means that the identity must exist and
    be active on the blockchain before the currency can be created. Additionally,
    the same symbol cannot be reused for another currency or blockchain, even if the
    identity is transferred, revoked, or recovered, unless the currency or blockchain
    has been deactivated as of a specified end block.


    When creating a currency, there are several options that can be specified to customize
    its behavior. These options are represented as a bitwise integer, where each bit
    corresponds to a specific option. The available options are:


    1. `OPTION_FRACTIONAL`: Allows reserve conversion using base calculations when
    set. This option enables fractional reserve conversions, which can be useful for
    certain types of currencies.

    2. `OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE`: If set, IDs may only be created by the controlling ID.
    This option restricts the creation of new IDs to the controlling ID, which can
    be useful for maintaining control over the currency.

    3. `OPTION_ID_STAKING`: All IDs on the chain stake equally, rather than value-based
    staking. This option changes the staking mechanism to a flat rate, rather than
    a value-based system.

    4. `OPTION_ID_REFERRALS`: If set, this chain supports referrals. This option enables
    referrals, which can be used to incentivize users to participate in the currency.

    5. `OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED`: If set, this chain requires referrals. This option
    makes referrals mandatory, which can be useful for ensuring that users are properly
    incentivized.

    6. `OPTION_TOKEN`: If set, this is a token, not a native currency. This option
    specifies that the currency is a token, rather than a native currency.

    7. `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY`: For PBaaS chains or gateways to potentially restrict
    to single currency. This option restricts the currency to a single currency, which
    can be useful for certain types of applications.

    8. `OPTION_GATEWAY`: If set, this routes external currencies. This option enables
    the currency to route external currencies, which can be useful for integrating
    with other blockchain systems.


    These options can be combined using bitwise operations to create a customized
    set of options for the currency. For example, to enable fractional reserve conversions
    and restrict ID creation to the controlling ID, the options would be `OPTION_FRACTIONAL
    | OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE`.


    It''s also important to note that all funds required to start the currency and
    for initial conversion amounts must be available to spend from the identity with
    the same name and ID as the currency being defined. This ensures that the currency
    is properly funded and can operate as intended.
