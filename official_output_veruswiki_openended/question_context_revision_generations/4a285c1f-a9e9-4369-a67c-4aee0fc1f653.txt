- content: 'You are checking whether a provided question and answer make sense if
    asked by themselves, with no additional information. You need to check for vague
    wording that a reader cannot interpret correctly, and questions that lack key
    context and would not be possibly answerable even if asked of someone with complete,
    masterful knowledge of the general subject matter of the question.


    In particular, you are checking for references to a "text" that is not provided,
    and you''re also hunting for anchor links to other information on the same document
    (such as)[#!/this/kind/of/thing.md], which will be broken links if they appear
    in the question or answer. Links that are URLs (external links) are fine, however.


    Evaluate the provided question-answer pair step-by-step. Following this, at the
    very end of your response, your "final judgment" or "final answer", you will write
    "PASS" or "FAIL" or "REWORD". A test should "PASS" if it "makes sense" and does
    not lack key context; it is a "FAIL" if it lacks key context, AND the question
    is not specific or clear. If it lacks context but the question is specific, pointed,
    and grounded, then it needs to be reworded to have the context-needing terms (i.e.,
    vague reference to "the text") removed. If it has no problems, it passes.


    The question may be part of a sequence of questions, so REFERENCES TO PREVIOUS
    STEPS ARE OK. It''s references to a text, or relative links, that are problems
    in need of fixing.


    If you decide to reword the question and answer, you MUST WRITE THE REWORDED QUESTION
    BELOW YOUR JUDGEMENT after the heading ### Question Rewording:


    I want you to especially check for vague references to "the text", "passage",
    and "excerpt". The question and answer should not mention unspecified, vague texts
    or excerpts.


    Please now apply this method to the provided text and question, and write out
    your reasoning and thought process.


    The goal with rewording is to have both the question and answer express a topic,
    fact, idea, or opinion in a GENERAL way that is NOT TIED TO ANY SPECIFIC CONTEXT
    which the reader does not have.

    What is the purpose of the steps outlined in the text, and what problem do they
    help to solve?



    **ANSWER:**


    The steps outlined in the text are designed to help resolve a situation where

    a Verus node''s blockchain has diverged from the correct chain, and the node is
    no longer in sync with the rest of the network. The steps allow the user to identify
    the earliest block that is causing the divergence, invalidate that block, and
    then resynchronize the node with the correct chain.

    ### Question Context Validation

    #### Special Term Context Check: specifically check for use of the terms "the
    text", "passage", and "excerpt". This question asks about "the text" without providing
    any context about the contents of this text.

    #### Scope and Precision: The question asks about "the steps outlined in the text",
    without specifying which steps are being considered, making this a vague question
    that lacks the context to be answers. Thus, this question fails this step.


    ### Answer Context Validation:

    #### Special Term Context Check: Specifically check for use of the terms "the
    text", "passage", and "excerpt". This answer references "the text" without being
    clear about what "the text" is.

    #### Answer-Only Context Issues: Confirm that the answer does not introduce new
    and vague context that the question does not. The answer mentions "the text",
    but this was already introduced by the question. The question''s doing so was
    flawed, but the answer still does not introduce new, vague context that the question
    does not. So this passes.

    #### Answer Anchor Link Check: The answer does not use any anchor links.


    ### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:

    #### Evaluation: Some checks related to the question or answer failed. So this
    question and answer should be reworded if they can be, or fail otherwise. The
    question (and the answer) both lack context in mentioning *which* "text" they
    refer to, and what its contents are. However, I do not know what text the question
    is referring to, so I can''t add this information. The question without reference
    to a specific text would be "What is the purpose of the steps, and what problem
    do they help to solve?" which is too broad and does not make sense. I cannot fix
    this by rewording it. Therefore, this fails.

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.

    What are some of the advanced command-line options available for customizing the
    behavior of a Verus wallet, and how do they affect its functionality?


    **ANSWER:**


    The Verus wallet offers a range of advanced command-line options that allow users
    to customize its behavior and tailor it to their specific needs. Here are some
    of these options and their effects on the wallet''s functionality:


    **Network and Whitelisting Options**


    The `-whitebind` option allows users to bind the wallet to a specific address
    and whitelist peers connecting to it. This can be useful for creating a dedicated
    gateway or node. The `-whitelist` option, on the other hand, enables users to
    whitelist specific IP addresses or netmasks, ensuring that peers connecting from
    those addresses are not subject to DoS banning and that their transactions are
    always relayed.


    **Arbitrage and Wallet Options**


    The `-arbitragecurrencies` option allows users to specify a list of currencies
    for arbitrage, while the `-arbitrageaddress` option designates a wallet address
    or identity to hold these currencies. The `-cheatcatcher` option is equivalent
    to the `-defaultzaddr` option, which sets a Sapling address for receiving fraud
    proof rewards and, if used with `-privatechange=1`, serves as the z-change address
    for the `sendcurrency` command.


    **Default ID and Z-Address Options**


    The `-defaultid` option sets a VerusID for default change output and staking reward
    recipients, while the `-defaultzaddr` option sets a Sapling address for receiving
    fraud proof rewards and, if used with `-privatechange=1`, serves as the z-change
    address for the `sendcurrency` command.


    **Wallet Disable and Key Pool Options**


    The `-disablewallet` option disables the wallet and wallet RPC calls, while the
    `-keypool` option sets the key pool size to a specified number (default: 100).


    **Transaction Fee Options**


    The `-maxtxfee` option sets the maximum total fees (in VRSC) to use in a single
    wallet transaction, while the `-paytxfee` option sets the fee (in VRSC/kB) to
    add to transactions sent.


    **Migration and Rescan Options**


    The `-migration` option enables the Sprout to Sapling migration, while the `-migrationdestaddress`
    option sets the Sapling migration address. The `-rescan` option rescan the block
    chain for missing wallet transactions on startup.


    **Private Change and Salvage Options**


    The `-privatechange` option directs all change from `sendcurency` or `z_sendmany`
    APIs to the default Sapling address set, if it is a valid Sapling address. The
    `-salvagewallet` option attempts to recover private keys from a corrupt wallet.dat
    on startup.


    These advanced command-line options provide users with fine-grained control over
    their Verus wallet''s behavior, allowing them to customize its functionality to
    suit their specific needs and use cases.
