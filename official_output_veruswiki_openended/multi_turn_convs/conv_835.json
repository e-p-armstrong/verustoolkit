    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to learn more about the Verus network. Can you tell me about some key features of the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, and how they support the creation and management of interoperable blockchains, as well as the locking and unlocking of IDs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network offers several key features that support the creation and management of interoperable blockchains, as well as the locking and unlocking of IDs.\n\nLet's dive into those features. \n\n**Interoperable Blockchains:**\nVerus allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains within the Verus network. This is achieved through the use of Notary IDs, which are specified at chain definition and provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that are easy to set up with easy bridging of public currencies. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.\n\n**Locking and Unlocking IDs:**\nVerus IDs can be locked or unlocked using various parameters. Two types of locks are available: Time Lock and Time Delay.\n\n**Time Lock:**\nA Time Lock defines the unlock height of an identity. This means that the ID will remain locked until a specified block height is reached. To set a Time Lock, you can use the `updateidentity` command, specifying the unlock height and other relevant parameters.\n\n**Time Delay:**\nA Time Delay defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. This means that even after the lock is removed, the ID will remain locked for a specified number of blocks. To set a Time Delay, you can use the `updateidentity` command, specifying the delay and other relevant parameters.\n\n**Revoking an Identity:**\nRevoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of any Time Lock or Time Delay settings. However, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\nOverall, the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network provides a flexible and powerful framework for creating and managing interoperable blockchains, as well as locking and unlocking IDs to ensure secure and controlled access.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these features, or how they can be used in different scenarios?",

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n#### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\n The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `get",
