    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there! I'm mining on the Verus network and I was wondering, how can I estimate the time it takes to find a block, and what factors affect this time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nEstimating the time it takes to find a block is a great question, and I'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nTo estimate the time it takes to find a block when mining on the Verus network, you can use a simple formula. This formula takes into account the network's overall mining power (NetworkHashrate), your own mining power (LocalHashrate), and the average time it takes to mine a block (BlockTime).\n\nThe formula is:\n```\nAverage Time To Find One Block = (NetworkHashrate / LocalHashrate) * BlockTime\n```\nHere's how to use this formula:\n\n1. **Get the NetworkHashrate**: You can find this value by running the `getmininginfo` command in the Verus CLI. This command will give you the current total mining power of the entire Verus network.\n2. **Get your LocalHashrate**: Run the `getmininginfo` command again to find your own mining power. This value represents how fast your mining setup can perform calculations.\n3. **Use the BlockTime**: The average time it takes to mine a block on Verus is 60 seconds.\n\nNow, plug in the values to get an estimate of how long it will take to find a block. For example, let's say you have a powerful mining setup with a LocalHashrate of 46159950, and the NetworkHashrate is 851125882237. Plugging in these values, we get:\n```\nAverage Time To Find One Block = (851125882237 / 46159950) * 60\nAverage Time To Find One Block = 1,106,317 seconds (307 hours or little under 13 days)\n```\nThis means that, on average, it will take around 13 days to find a block with your mining setup.\n\nKeep in mind that this is just an estimate, and the actual time it takes to find a block can vary significantly. You may find a block much sooner or later than the predicted time. However, over a long period, the actual time will average out to the predicted value.\n\nRemember to update your calculations whenever your mining setup or the NetworkHashrate changes.\n\nDo you have any questions about this formula or how to apply it to your mining setup?",

            "[gimmick: math]()\n\n# Question: I'm mining since XYZ with XYZ, why I haven't found a block yet?\n\n$$ Average Time To Find One Block = ( \\frac{NetworkHashrate}{LocalHashrate} ) * BlockTime $$\n\nOne block = 6 coins (as now)\nNetworkHashrate = retrieved by `getmininginfo` command from </>CLI\nLocalHashrate = retrieved by `getmininginfo` command\nBlockTime = 60 seconds (average)\nnote: The above formula assumes you are already mining and your hashrate is already included in the `NetworkHashrate`. For very large LocalHashrate calculations (what-if-I-had scenario) add it to the NetworkHashrate yourself.\n\nReal example with - 31 threads AMD Ryzen 5950x @ 4.4Ghz -\n\n$$ Average Time To Find One Block = ( \\frac{851125882237}{46159950} ) * 60 $$\n$$ Average Time To Find One Block = 1,106,317 seconds (307 hours or little under 13 days) $$\n\nBear in mind that these are average times to find a block. In real life you may hit a block much sooner or later after finding the last. In the long run it averages out to the values predicted.\n\n(submitted by @TexWiller, edited by Oink.vrsc@)\n\nnote: last revision date 2023-06-21",
