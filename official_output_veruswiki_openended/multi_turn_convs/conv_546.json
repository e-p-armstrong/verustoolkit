    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to figure out how to use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds in Verus. Can you walk me through that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert funds between different addresses and currencies. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\n**Sending Funds:**\nYou can use `sendcurrency` to send funds from one address to another. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from an address \"bob@\" to an address \"alice@\", you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nIf you want to send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, you can use the \"*\" wildcard as the source address. For example:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nDo you have any questions about these examples, or would you like to know more about how to use `sendcurrency` for converting funds between different currencies?\n\n(Note: I removed the exclamation mark at the end of the second code block, as it seemed out of place. Let me know if you'd like me to add it back or make any other changes!)",
