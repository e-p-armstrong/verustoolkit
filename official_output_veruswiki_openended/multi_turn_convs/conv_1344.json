    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm exploring the multi-currency features in Verus and I'd like to know more about the limitations I should be aware of, specifically when creating currencies from IDs and naming conventions.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen working with multi-currency features in Verus, there are some important limitations to keep in mind to avoid potential issues and user confusion.\n\n**Limitation 1: IDs with i-addresses as names**\nIn both the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI), you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. It is generally not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name, as it will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (in many cases). To avoid user confusion, the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations will also be expanded.\n\n**Limitation 2: GUI restriction on existing currency names**\nIn the GUI, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is currently considered errata for the testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.\n\n**Important Disclaimer**\nIt is essential to note that this software is experimental and unfinished, and users should be aware that it is used at their own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage that may occur.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these limitations or multi-currency features in Verus in general?",

            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!
