    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm thinking of installing Verus, but I have some concerns about the warranty and liability. Can you tell me what kind of warranty and liability does the Verus software come with? Also, what should I know about potential false positives when installing it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to clarify that for you.\n\nThe Verus software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that the authors and copyright holders of the software do not guarantee that it will work as expected, or that it is suitable for a particular purpose. They also disclaim any liability for damages or other claims arising from the use of the software.\n\nRegarding potential false positives, it's important to note that some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is not because the software is malicious, but rather because it is mining software that could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC.\n\nThese false positives are a common issue with cryptocurrency mining software, and it's essential to understand that they do not indicate that the software is harmful. You can learn more about these false positives by reviewing resources from reputable sources, such as Malwarebytes and Kaspersky.\n\nAdditionally, Verus provides links to VirusTotal, a website that analyzes files for malware and other threats, to demonstrate that their software is clean and safe to use.\n\nDo you have any other questions about this, or would you like more information on how to proceed with the installation?",
