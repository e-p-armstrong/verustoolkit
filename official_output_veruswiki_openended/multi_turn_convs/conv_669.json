    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand VerusIDs better. Can you tell me what they are and what benefits they offer in terms of security, control, and flexibility?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are a type of identity on the Verus network that offer a range of benefits, including security, control, and flexibility.\n\nLet me break it down for you. \n\n**Security:** VerusIDs are quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses, which means they are resistant to quantum attacks using known algorithms. Although Verus does not currently use quantum-resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs themselves are secure, and the platform is working on integrating a quantum-secure signature scheme. This will allow users to change their ID and make all funds sent to it retroactively quantum-resistant.\n\n**Control:** VerusIDs are fully decentralized, meaning anyone can create one without needing permission. The creator of a VerusID has complete control over it, and all costs associated with creating an ID are paid to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\n\n**Flexibility:** VerusIDs offer a range of features that provide flexibility and convenience. They can be used to receive and send funds, and the controlling addresses or multi-sig properties can be changed by the controller of the identity. If these changes are made, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity will follow the updated spend conditions and be subject to the updated keys. VerusIDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, although only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n**Additional Features:** VerusIDs also offer additional features, such as revocability. Each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and has the permission to revoke the identity. This creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds. This feature is useful in cases of key theft, for example.\n\nI hope that helps! Do you have any more questions about VerusIDs or their features?",

            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. VerusIDs are:- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.",
