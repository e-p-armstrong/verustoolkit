    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading through the Verus documentation and I have a question about the legal disclaimers and potential issues with virus scanners related to the Verus software. Can you clarify what I should know about this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, of course! It's essential to understand the legal disclaimers and potential issues with virus scanners when using the Verus software.\n\nThe Verus software is provided \"as is\" without any warranties, either express or implied. This means that the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software. This disclaimer covers various scenarios, including contract, tort, or other actions.\n\nAdditionally, some virus scanners, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software includes mining capabilities, which can be exploited by third parties to misuse your computer. However, these warnings are false positives, and the software is not malicious.\n\nTo better understand these false positives, you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky, which explain the concept of PUPs and how they are flagged by virus scanners.\n\nFinally, Verus provides links to VirusTotal, a service that analyzes files for viruses and malware, to demonstrate the safety of their software. These links are provided for MacOS, Linux-AMD64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows versions of the software.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the legal disclaimers or virus scanner issues? Or would you like more information on how to use VirusTotal to verify the safety of the Verus software?",
