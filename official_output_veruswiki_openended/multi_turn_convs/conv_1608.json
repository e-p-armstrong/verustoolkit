Can you tell me more about that? And where can I find information about the software's integrity and potential security risks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is experimental and unfinished, and it is provided \"as is\" without any warranty or guarantee. This means that users are responsible for any potential damage or issues that may arise from using the software.\n\nIn terms of licensing, the Verus software is licensed under a permissive license that allows users to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software without restriction. However, this license also includes a disclaimer of warranty, which means that the authors and copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software.\n\nAdditionally, the software comes with a warning that it is still experimental and unfinished, and users should use it at their own risk. This warning is meant to inform users that the software may not be stable or reliable, and that they should be cautious when using it.\n\nTo help mitigate potential security risks, the developers of Verus provide links to VirusTotal, a website that scans files for viruses and malware. These links allow users to check the integrity of the software and ensure that it is free from known security threats. The links are provided for different operating systems, including MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows. By checking the VirusTotal reports, users can get an idea of whether the software is safe to use and whether it has been flagged for any potential security issues.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the licensing terms or security risks associated with the Verus software?",
