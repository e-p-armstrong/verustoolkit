    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm about to start using the Verus software, but before I do, I want to know what kind of disclaimers and warnings I should be aware of. Can you also tell me how I can verify the safety of the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nExcellent question! It's always important to be aware of the disclaimers and warnings associated with any software you're about to use.\n\nThe Verus software is provided \"as is\", without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that the authors and copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liabilities arising from the use of the software.\n\nAdditionally, some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software is mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC.\n\nTo verify the safety of the software, you can check the virus detection results on VirusTotal, a website that analyzes files and URLs for viruses and malware. The links provided are for the MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows versions of the software, respectively. These links will show you the detection results from various antivirus engines, which can help you determine if the software is safe to use.\n\nIt's also important to note that false positives can occur, where antivirus software flags a legitimate program as malicious. You can learn more about false positives and how they work by reviewing resources from reputable cybersecurity companies, such as Malwarebytes and Kaspersky.\n\nIn summary, while the Verus software is provided without warranties, you can take steps to verify its safety by checking virus detection results and understanding how antivirus software works.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the disclaimers and warnings, or how to verify the safety of the software?",
