    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand how Verus Vault works. Can you explain how it protects and recovers funds, and what are some of its key features and use cases?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a decentralized solution that provides a new level of blockchain protection and recovery for funds, IDs, and NFTs. It allows users to lock their VerusIDs, which can then be revoked and recovered by their revocation and recovery authority identities in case of unauthorized access. This mechanism circumvents the lock, providing an additional layer of security.\n\nHere's how it works: when a VerusID is locked, only the revocation and recovery authority identities can access the funds, even if someone has the primary keys. This means that even with a multisig of primary keys, the user must first unlock the ID and then wait for a predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access the funds. This unlock delay can be set to a specific time period, such as 24 hours, which provides protection against the \"5 dollar wrench attack\".\n\nVerus Vault offers several key features and use cases, including:\n\n* **Decentralized funds recovery:** Verus Vault allows users to recover their funds in case of unauthorized access or loss, without the need for a bank or centralized authority.\n* **ID and NFT protection:** Verus Vault provides the same level of security for IDs and NFTs as it does for funds, ensuring that these assets are protected and can be recovered in case of loss or theft.\n* **Time locks:** Verus Vault can be used to create time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance, providing a secure and decentralized way to manage assets over time.\n* **Exporting IDs to PBaaS chains:** Verus Vault also allows users to export their IDs to PBaaS chains, which enables the creation of more complex and decentralized applications.\n\nOverall, Verus Vault provides a robust and decentralized solution for protecting and recovering funds, IDs, and NFTs, and offers a range of features and use cases that can be used to manage assets in a secure and decentralized manner.\n\nDo you have any further questions about Verus Vault or how it can be used to protect your assets?",

            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",
