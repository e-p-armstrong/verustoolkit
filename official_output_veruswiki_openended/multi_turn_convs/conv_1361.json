    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I just downloaded the Verus software, and I want to make sure it's legitimate and hasn't been tampered with. What are the steps to verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus download, and what tools are available to help with this process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerifying the authenticity and integrity of a Verus download is a crucial step to ensure that you're installing legitimate software and not exposing your system to potential risks. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you verify your Verus downloads:\n\nFirst, it's essential to understand that some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). These warnings are false positives, indicating that the software is mining-related, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC.\n\nTo verify the authenticity and integrity of your Verus download, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Extract the downloaded archive**: Extract the downloaded archive file (e.g., `.tar.gz`) to a directory of your choice.\n2. **Verify the signature**: Look for a `.txt` file included with the download, which contains the signer, standard SHA256 file checksum, and signature. This file is used to verify the authenticity of the download.\n3. **Verify the signature using the CLI**: Use the `verus` command-line tool to verify the signature. You can do this in two ways:\n\t* **Verify the file directly**: Use the `verifyfile` command, specifying the signer, signature, and file path. For example:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.4-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.4-x86_64.tar.gz\n```\n\t* **Verify using a checksum**: Use the `verifyhash` command, specifying the signer, signature, and SHA256 checksum. For example:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> 2b7fcb26fc38f34e1fd77e581716c1cd8b4eee1f0f01627dfd2ef56170a8e2f4\n```\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that your Verus download is authentic and has not been tampered with during transmission.\n\nDo you have any questions about this process or need further assistance?",
