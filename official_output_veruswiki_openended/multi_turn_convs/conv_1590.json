    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to wrap my head around how identities work in Verus. Can you explain their structure, authorities, and transferability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIdentities are a core concept in Verus, and understanding how they work is crucial for leveraging the platform's advanced features. \n\nIn Verus, identities are composed of a set of addresses (one or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of the identity.\n\nEach identity has three authorities: Primary, Revocation, and Recovery. The Primary authority is the self-identity and has control over the identity, except for its name and parent, which are derived from the blockchain on which it is defined. The Primary authority can modify any part of the identity, except for the Revocation and Recovery authorities, once they are specified.\n\nThe Revocation authority has the power to revoke the Primary identity, which will freeze all funds and transactions under its control. However, the Revocation authority cannot spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n\nThe Recovery authority can redefine or recover a revoked identity, but it cannot change the Revocation authority, nor can it modify an unrevoked identity in any way.\n\nIdentities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party's control. When identities are transferred, the Revocation and Recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, depending on the authority of the party updating the ID.\n\nWhen an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. The native wallet in Verus automatically reflects these changes in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity.\n\nFinally, if a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure, is added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend condition. This ensures that identities in Verus are future-proof and can adapt to new security standards and technologies.\n\nDo you have any more questions about identities in Verus, or would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?",

            "How do identities work in Verus, including their structure, authorities, and transferability?",
            "In Verus, identities are a fundamental concept that enables advanced functionality and control over transactions and funds. An identity in Verus consists of a set of addresses (one or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of the identity.\n\nEach identity has three authorities: Primary, Revocation, and Recovery. The Primary authority is the self-identity and has control over the identity, except for its name and parent, which are derived from the blockchain on which it is defined. The Primary authority can modify any part of the identity, except for the Revocation and Recovery authorities, once they are specified.\n\nThe Revocation authority has the power to revoke the Primary identity, which will freeze all funds and transactions under its control. However, the Revocation authority cannot spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n\nThe Recovery authority can redefine or recover a revoked identity, but it cannot change the Revocation authority, nor can it modify an unrevoked identity in any way.\n\nIdentities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party's control. When identities are transferred, the Revocation and Recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, depending on the authority of the party updating the ID.\n\nWhen an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. The native wallet in Verus automatically reflects these changes in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity.\n\nFinally, if a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure, is added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend condition. This ensures that identities in Verus are future-proof and can adapt to new security standards and technologies.",
            "ntity must have a set of addresses (1 or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity. Each identity also refers to two additional identities that have authority over:\n  - **Primary** - this is the self identity and may modify any part of the identity except its name, its parent, which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined, and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.\n  - **Revocation** - this identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n  - **Recovery** - this authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all.\n3. Identities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party\u2019s control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so.\n4. If an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity using \u201cz_getbalance identity@\u201d.\n5. If later, a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure s added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend condition",
