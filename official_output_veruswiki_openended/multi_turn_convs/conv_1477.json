    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been playing around with Verus IDs, and I'm curious about some of the advanced features. Could you tell me more about locking and unlocking Verus IDs, and how to query conversion options between different currencies on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs have several advanced features that allow for customizable control and security. One of these features is the ability to lock and unlock IDs, which can be done using the `updateidentity` command.\n\n**Locking IDs:**\nThere are two types of locks that can be applied to a Verus ID: Time Lock and Time Delay. \n\n**Time Lock:** \nA Time Lock sets a specific block height at which the ID will unlock. This can be useful for creating a trustless escrow or other timed-release scenarios. To set a Time Lock, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n**Time Delay:**\nA Time Delay sets a delay, measured in blocks, before an ID can be unlocked after its flags are set back to an unlocked state. This can be useful for adding an extra layer of security to prevent rapid changes to an ID's flags. To set a Time Delay, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n**Unlocking IDs:**\nIt's important to note that revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of any Time Lock or Time Delay settings. Additionally, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**Conversion Queries:**\nVerus also provides a feature to query conversion options between different currencies on the network. This can be done using the `getcurrencyconverters` API. This API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. \n\nFor example, to query conversion options between BTC and ETH, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis will return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\nDo you have any more questions about locking and unlocking Verus IDs, or querying conversion options on the Verus network?",
