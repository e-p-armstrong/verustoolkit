    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm interested in launching a new currency on the Verus network. Could you please walk me through the process and explain the requirements for launching a currency? Additionally, how can I convert VRSCTEST to the new currency, and what happens if the currency launch is successful or unsuccessful?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLaunching a new currency on the Verus network is an exciting endeavor. To help you get started, I'll break down the requirements and steps involved in launching a new currency.\n\n**Requirements:**\n\n1. **Funding:** The currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST.\n2. **Preconversion:** A minimum of 1000 VRSCTEST must be preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per unit of the new currency (in this case, GOLD).\n3. **Launch timing:** The currency launch will start 50 blocks from when the transaction is made (by default).\n\n**Launching a Currency:**\nTo initiate a currency launch, you need to send a specific transaction to the Verus network. This transaction will trigger the launch process, which is part of the mining process. As part of the launch, mining the blocks that launch the currency earns a 0.025% conversion fee, which is used to convert VRSCTEST to the new currency (GOLD).\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to the New Currency:**\nBefore the block where the GOLD token launches, you can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command effectively parks your conversion until the token launches. If the launch is successful, you will receive 0.975 GOLD in your wallet. If the launch is unsuccessful, you will have your VRSCTEST back.\n\n**Creating a New Currency (mycoin):**\nAssuming the GOLD token launches successfully, you can create a new currency (mycoin) that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. The process of creating mycoin involves defining its properties, such as its name, options, and conversion rates, using the `definecurrency` command.\n\nNote that, currently, new tokens can only be created through a centralized issuance option. However, this may change in the future as the Verus network continues to evolve.\n\nDo you have any further questions about launching a new currency on the Verus network, or would you like more information on the `definecurrency` command?",
