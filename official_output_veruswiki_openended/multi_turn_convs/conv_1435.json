    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to figure out how to use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds on the Verus network. Can you show me some examples of how to do this, including converting between different currencies and sending cross-chain to a PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert funds on the Verus network. Here are some examples of how you can use it:\n\n**Sending Funds:**\nYou can use `sendcurrency` to send funds from one address to another. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from `bob@` to `alice@`, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nYou can also send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients using friendly-name z-addresses.\n\n**Converting Currencies:**\n`sendcurrency` also allows you to convert between different currencies. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC, using IDs as a funding source, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC, through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC.\n\n**Preconverting to a New Currency:**\nIf you want to convert to a new currency that is not yet active, you can use the `preconvert` option. For example, to preconvert 10 VRSCTEST to a new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\n**Sending Cross-Chain:**\n`sendcurrency` also allows you to send funds cross-chain to a PBaaS chain. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from the Verus chain to the PBaaSChain, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv\",\"amount\":10, \"exportto\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert VRSCTEST cross-chain to PBaaSChain using the `convertto` option.\n\nOverall, the `sendcurrency` API provides a flexible and powerful way to send and convert funds on the Verus network, including converting between different currencies and sending cross-chain to a PBaaS chain. Do you have any questions about these examples, or would you like to know more about using `sendcurrency`?",
