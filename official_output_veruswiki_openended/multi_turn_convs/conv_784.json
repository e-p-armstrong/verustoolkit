    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to send and convert currency using the `sendcurrency` API in Verus. Can you walk me through the different ways to do this and provide some examples of how to use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool for sending and converting funds. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\n**Sending Funds:**\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` API to send funds from one address to another. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@), you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nYou can also send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients with friendly-name z-addresses. For example:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Converting Funds:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API also allows you to convert funds from one currency to another. For example, you can convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC, using IDs as a funding source:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC, through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThese are just a few examples of how you can use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds in Verus. Note that all testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset, so be sure to use this API responsibly.\n\nDo you have any questions about using the `sendcurrency` API, or would you like more information on a specific use case?",
