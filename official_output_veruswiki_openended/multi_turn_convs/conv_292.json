    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to figure out how to check the amount of Verus coins received by an account or address. Can you walk me through the different ways to do that and what parameters are used in the commands?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides several ways to check the amount of coins received by an account or address. There are two main commands used for this purpose: `getreceivedbyaccount` and `getreceivedbyaddress`.\n\nThe `getreceivedbyaccount` command is used to get the total amount received by the default account or a specific account. The command format is:\n```bash\n> verus getreceivedbyaccount [account_name] [minconf]\n```\nHere, `account_name` is the name of the account (optional, default is the default account), and `minconf` is the minimum number of confirmations required (optional, default is 1).\n\nLet me give you some examples:\n\n* To get the amount received by the default account with at least 1 confirmation:\n```bash\n> verus getreceivedbyaccount \"\"\n```\n* To get the amount received by the \"tabby\" account including unconfirmed amounts with zero confirmations:\n```bash\n> verus getreceivedbyaccount \"tabby\" 0\n```\n* To get the amount received by the \"tabby\" account with at least 6 confirmations:\n```bash\n> verus getreceivedbyaccount \"tabby\" 6\n```\nThis command can also be used as a JSON RPC call:\n```bash\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getreceivedbyaccount\", \"params\": [\"tabby\", 6] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nThe `getreceivedbyaddress` command is used to get the total amount received by a specific Verus address. The command format is:\n```bash\n> verus getreceivedbyaddress [address] [minconf]\n```\nHere, `address` is the Verus address, and `minconf` is the minimum number of confirmations required (optional, default is 1).\n\nLet me give you some examples:\n\n* To get the amount received by the address \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" with at least 1 confirmation:\n```bash\n> verus getreceivedbyaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\"\n```\n* To get the amount received by the address \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" including unconfirmed transactions with zero confirmations:\n```bash\n> verus getreceivedbyaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 0\n```\n* To get the amount received by the address \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" with at least 6 confirmations:\n```bash\n> verus getreceivedbyaddress \"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\" 6\n```\nThis command can also be used as a JSON RPC call:\n```bash\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getreceivedbyaddress\", \"params\": [\"RD6GgnrMpPaTSMn8vai6yiGA7mN4QGPV\", 6] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nNote that the `minconf` parameter is optional and defaults to 1, which means the command will only include transactions with at least 1 confirmation.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these commands or how to use them?",
