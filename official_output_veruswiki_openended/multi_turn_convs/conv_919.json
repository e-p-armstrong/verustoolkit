    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm interested in using Verus software, but I want to make sure I understand the legal disclaimers and potential false positives associated with it. Can you also tell me about some notable changes and features of the Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) and Verus Reserve cross-chain currency conversion technology?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using Verus software, it's crucial to understand the legal disclaimers and potential false positives associated with it. I'd be happy to explain.\n\nFirstly, the software is provided \"as is,\" without any warranty or liability for damages or claims arising from its use. This means that the authors and copyright holders are not responsible for any issues that may arise from using the software.\n\nRegarding false positives, some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software includes mining capabilities, which could potentially be exploited by third parties to use your computer's resources without your consent.\n\nIt's essential to understand that these warnings are not indicating that the software is malicious, but rather that it has the potential to be used for unintended purposes. To learn more about these false positives, you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky.\n\nNow, about the notable changes and features of the Verus software: it now properly distributes initial contributions on non-reserve chains, displays the chain name on failure to notarize, continues attempting to notarize after running out of notary rewards, and fixes issues with getting defined chains' currency state.\n\nMoreover, the Verus technology offers a range of innovative features, including Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) and cross-chain currency conversion technology. This technology enables the creation of customized blockchains and allows for seamless currency conversion between different chains, making it a powerful tool for developers and users alike.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the legal disclaimers, false positives, or features of the Verus software and technology?",
