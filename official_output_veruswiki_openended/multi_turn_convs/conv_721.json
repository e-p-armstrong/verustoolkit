    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into the Verus PBaaS Multi-currency Tokens on the TestNet, but I'm not entirely sure what they're capable of or how to get started. Can you tell me more about the key features and capabilities of these tokens, and how I can launch the testnet and define a currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus PBaaS Multi-currency Tokens on the TestNet offer a range of features and capabilities that enable the creation and management of tokens on the Verus network. Some of the key features include:\n\n* **Token definitions and launches**: Tokens can be defined and launched on the TestNet, with customizable parameters such as conversion prices, minimums, and maximums of participation.\n* **Multi-currency support**: Tokens can accept multiple other coins or tokens for conversion, and can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies.\n* **Blockchain-controlled tokens**: Tokens can be controlled by the blockchain, allowing for decentralized management and use cases such as payment models, tickets, point systems, and more.\n* **Partially blockchain-controlled tokens**: Tokens can also be partially controlled by a central authority, allowing for minting and management of currency supplies.\n* **Aggregated outgoing transactions**: Tokens can be configured to receive aggregated outgoing transactions to external systems, allowing for integration with decentralized networks or centralized custodial systems.\n\nTo launch the testnet, you can use the command `./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST`. This will start the testnet, allowing you to create and manage tokens on the Verus network.\n\nTo define a currency, you need to use the `definecurrency` API, which allows you to specify the properties of the currency, such as its name, options, proof protocol, currencies, conversions, eras, notaries, and more. The exact command and parameters will depend on the specific requirements of your currency.\n\nNote that the Verus PBaaS Multi-currency Tokens are currently available only on the TestNet, but they offer a powerful and flexible way to create and manage tokens on the Verus network.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the Verus PBaaS Multi-currency Tokens or how to use them on the TestNet?",

These tokens can be sent through the Verus protocol using the new 'sendcurrency' API, which works for all currencies in the Verus network. Tokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies as well. Token launches can accept multiple other coins or tokens for conversion to the new token with payment to the token ID. Each token can have a different conversion price for pre-launch participation as well as minimums and maximums of participation. If minimums are not met by the currency's startblock, all participation will be refunded, less a minimal transfer/network fee, which was already allocated to miners/stakers.Tokens can be controlled by the blockchain and used for many purposes, including payment models, tickets, point systems, etc., or they can be partially blockchain controlled, centralized tokens, with currencies that are mintable at any time by the ID behind them. The controlling ID can also receive receive aggregated outgoing transactions to external systems that both burn coins and pass account data in the process. This will allow applications to control currency supplies on the public network, whether these applications are external, decentralized networks or centralized custodial systems, in many typical use cases of tokens, including club coins, game tokens, token launches, etc., no programming is required.## Defining a CurrencyTo create a currency of a specific name, you need ",
