    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how Verus incentivizes the creation of new identities. Can you explain how that works, and what happens to the funds that aren't paid to referrers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus has a clever system in place to incentivize the creation of new identities. \n\nVerus incentivizes the creation of new identities through a referral system that rewards referrers and miners or stakers of the blockchain. When a new identity is created, 20 VRSC are distributed to the referrer's ID, 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's ID, and 20 VRSC to the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID. Additionally, 20 VRSC are awarded to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined.\n\nThe remaining funds that are not paid to referrers are distributed to miners or stakers of the blockchain, ensuring that 100% of the funds are utilized to support the network. This system encourages users to create new identities and refer others to do so, while also incentivizing miners and stakers to secure the network and validate transactions.\n\nSo, to summarize, the funds are distributed in a way that benefits both the referrers and the network as a whole, ensuring a healthy and active community.\n\nDo you have any further questions about this referral system or how it benefits the Verus network?",
