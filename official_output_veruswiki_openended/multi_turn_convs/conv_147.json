    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been experimenting with Verus's multi-currency feature, and I was wondering if there are any limitations I should be aware of? I want to make sure I'm using it correctly and avoiding any potential issues.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using Verus's multi-currency feature, there are a few limitations to keep in mind to avoid potential issues. Here are two key limitations to be aware of:\n\n**Limitation 1: Using an i-address as an ID name**\nIn Verus, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because, when referring to a currency, an i-address will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but it will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (in many cases). To avoid user confusion, the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations will also be expanded.\n\n**Limitation 2: Currency name conflicts in the GUI**\nIn the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is specific to the GUI and may be addressed in future releases.\n\n**Important Note: Experimental Software**\nIt is essential to remember that this software is still experimental and unfinished. Use it at your own risk, as it comes with no warranty for any kind of damage.\n\nDoes that help clarify things for you? Are you planning on creating your own currency with Verus's multi-currency feature? Do you have any other questions about these limitations or how to use the feature effectively?",

            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!
