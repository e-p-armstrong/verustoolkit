    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand the JSON object returned by Verus for a transaction. Can you explain what information is contained in it and what each of the fields represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen you query a transaction on the Verus network, the JSON object returned contains various fields that provide insight into the transaction. Let me break down each field for you:\n\nThe JSON object contains the following fields:\n\n* `n` (numeric, sprout): This represents the index of the JSDescription within vJoinSplit.\n* `\"jsOutput\"`: `n` (numeric, sprout): This is the index of the output within the JSDescription.\n* `\"output\"`: `n` (numeric, sapling): This is the index of the output within the vShieldedOutput.\n* `\"address\"`: `\"zcashaddress\"` (string): This is the Zcash address involved in the transaction.\n* `\"recovered\"`: `true|false` (boolean, sapling): This field indicates whether the output is not for an address in the wallet. If `true`, it means the output is not for an address in the wallet.\n* `\"value\"`: `x.xxx` (numeric): This is the amount of the transaction in VRSC.\n* `\"valueZat\"`: `xxxx` (numeric): This is the amount of the transaction in zatoshis, which is a smaller unit of VRSC.\n* `\"memo\"`: `\"hexmemo\"` (string): This is the hexadecimal string representation of the memo field, which is an optional field that can be used to store additional information about the transaction.\n* `\"memoStr\"`: `\"memo\"` (string): This field is only returned if the memo field contains valid UTF-8 text. It is a string representation of the memo field.\n\nThese fields provide a comprehensive view of the transaction, including the addresses involved, the amounts transferred, and any additional information stored in the memo field.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these fields or how to interpret them?",
