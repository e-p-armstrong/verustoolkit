    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the purpose of the software provided, and how I can define and connect to a new PBaaS chain using Verus. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe software provided is a test release intended for testing and development with public blockchains as a service (PBaaS). It's important to note that it's not an official release and should be used at your own risk. It doesn't support PBaaS on the mainnet and shouldn't be used as a main wallet.\n\nNow, let's talk about defining a new PBaaS chain. You can use the `definechain` command to do so. Here's an example:\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{ \"name\":\"SOMECOIN\", \"eras\": [{\"reward\" : 10000000000}], \"notarizationreward\" : 1440000000, \"billingperiod\" : 1440, \"nodes\" : [{\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2500\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"\"}, {\"nodeaddress\" : \"127.0.0.1:2501\", \"paymentaddress\" : \"RDyDzC5JB66Y29fzBkamywqEn1PJXTzj8B\"}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a new chain named `SOMECOIN` with specific properties such as eras, notarization reward, billing period, and nodes.\n\nTo connect to the new chain, you can use the command:\n```\n./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\nOn the first connection, a local config file is created, and you won't need to run Verus to connect again. However, you will need to run Verus to merge mine.\n\nKeep in mind that you'll need to have VRSCTEST in your wallet to create a chain, and there are specific requirements for the chain definition, such as a maximum of 3 eras, a minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations, and a minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.\n\nDo you have any more questions about defining and connecting to a new PBaaS chain using Verus?",

However, it will be needed to merge mine.The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.# Disclaimer",
