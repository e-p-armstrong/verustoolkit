    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm interested in working with multi-currency functionality in Verus, especially when creating currencies and PBaaS chains. Are there any important limitations and considerations I should be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen working with multi-currency functionality in Verus, there are some important limitations and considerations to be aware of.\n\n**First Limitation:** Be cautious when creating an ID with an i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used, and is not supported for creating currencies. The advice is to avoid doing this, as it can lead to user confusion. In fact, the naming system will be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations to reduce the potential for user confusion.\n\n**Second Limitation (GUI only):** If a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This is currently a limitation, but it is considered errata and will not be a limitation in the future.\n\n**Disclaimer:** It's essential to note that the software is experimental and unfinished, and users should be aware that they use it at their own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage.\n\n**Licensing:** The software is open-source and freely available for use, modification, and distribution, subject to certain conditions. The enclosed copyright notice and permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n\nKeep these limitations and considerations in mind to ensure a smooth experience when working with multi-currency functionality in Verus. Do you have any further questions about these limitations or any other aspect of Verus?",

            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!
