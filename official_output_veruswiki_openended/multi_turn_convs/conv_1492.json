    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into DeFi protocols and I'm curious about how Verus prevents miners or stakers from manipulating transactions. Can you explain how the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol works to prevent such attempts, and what key adjustments were made to further prevent them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol is a fascinating topic, and I'd be happy to break it down for you.\n\nThe Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol is designed to prevent miners or stakers from attempting to manipulate transactions, such as front-running or excluding certain transactions from a block, in order to gain an unfair advantage. This is achieved through a combination of mechanisms that disincentivize such behavior and provide rewards for honest behavior.\n\nOne key aspect of the protocol is the way it handles exports and imports. Conversions and cross-chain transfers are rolled up into exports, which are collected from one or more blocks of transfer transactions. However, to determine when a block is the last of the prior export or first in the next, a random bit is pulled from later blocks. This adds an element of unpredictability and makes it harder for miners or stakers to manipulate the order of transactions.\n\nAnother important adjustment is the way fees are distributed. The last miner or staker to complete a block of an export retroactively receives 10% of all fees from processing that export, including all conversions, once the rollup is processed as an import. This reward used to go to the miner or staker who processes the export, but this change ensures that the reward is given to the one who completes the block, rather than the one who initiates the export.\n\nAdditionally, import transactions can now include up to n/2 arbitrage transactions, where n is the number of reserves in a liquidity basket currency. This allows for more flexibility and opportunities for arbitrage, making it more attractive for miners or stakers to engage in honest behavior and earn rewards through arbitrage rather than attempting to manipulate transactions.\n\nOverall, the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol is designed to create a fair and transparent environment where miners and stakers are incentivized to act honestly and contribute to the integrity of the network. By introducing elements of unpredictability and rewarding honest behavior, the protocol makes it more difficult for individuals to attempt to manipulate transactions and gain an unfair advantage.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol or how it prevents transaction manipulation?",

            "For testnet, v0.9.5-1 fixes an issue discovered on testnet where duplicate ID exports blocked cross-chain processing temporarily and also introduces a protocol improvement designed to make the Verus anti-MEV DeFi protocol even more resistant than what we believe was already the leading algorithm to multi-block attempts at MEV. The protocol change makes the following adjustments:Conversions and cross-chain transfers still roll-up into exports that are collected from one or more blocks of transfer transactions, but to determine when a block is the last of the prior export or first in the next requires a random bit pulled from later blocks.\nThe last miner or staker to complete a block of an export retroactively receives 10% of all fees from processing that export, including all conversions, once the rollup is processed as an import. This reward used to go to the miner or staker who processes the export, which is no longer the case.\nImport transactions can now include up to n/2 arbitrage transactions, where n is the number of reserves in a liquidity basket currency.These changes together serve to disincentivize any miner or staker from attempting to exclude a large set of transactions from a block and front run all of them, as they will have an even chance of having all of those excluded transactions put back in with their transaction, turning potential gain into potential loss. They would be better off saving their working capital to arbitrage imports by joining transactions, bringing them close to market, and earning money without risk of loss. In addition, if they do end up putting more value of transactions in a block that caps the export rollup, they will reliably earn meaningful rewards without risk of loss in that way as well.",
