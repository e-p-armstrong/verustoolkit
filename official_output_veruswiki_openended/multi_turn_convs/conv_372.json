    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with managing my addresses on Verus. Can you walk me through how to use Verus commands to manage and interact with my addresses, including getting the balance of an address, generating a new shielded address, and retrieving the result of an operation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nManaging your addresses on Verus can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, I'm here to help! Verus provides several commands that allow you to manage and interact with your addresses. Here's a breakdown of how to use these commands:\n\n**Getting the Balance of an Address:**\nThe `z_getbalance` command is used to get the total amount of KMD received by a specific address. You can use this command in different ways depending on your needs. To get the total amount received by an address, you can simply run the command with the address as an argument, like this:\n```bash\n> verus z_getbalance \"myaddress\"\n```\nIf you want to only include transactions that have been confirmed at least a certain number of times, you can specify the minimum number of confirmations as an optional argument, like this:\n```bash\n> verus z_getbalance \"myaddress\" 5\n```\nThis will return the total amount received by the address, but only including transactions that have been confirmed at least 5 times. You can also use this command as a JSON RPC call, like this:\n```bash\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_getbalance\", \"params\": [\"myaddress\", 5] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n**Generating a New Shielded Address:**\nThe `z_getnewaddress` command is used to generate a new shielded address for receiving payments. You can use this command with or without arguments. If you run the command with no arguments, it will return a new Sapling address, like this:\n```bash\n> verus z_getnewaddress\n```\nIf you want to specify the type of address, you can do so by passing the type as an argument, like this:\n```bash\n> verus z_getnewaddress sapling\n```\nYou can also use this command as a JSON RPC call, like this:\n```bash\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"z_getnewaddress\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n**Retrieving the Result of an Operation:**\nThe `z_getoperationresult` command is used to retrieve the result and status of an operation that has finished, and then remove the operation from memory. You can use this command by passing the operation ID as an argument, like this:\n```bash\n> verus z_getoperationresult '[\"operationid\",... ]'\n```\nThis will return the result and status of the operation, and then remove it from memory.\n\nDo you have any questions about these commands, or would you like more information on using them?",
