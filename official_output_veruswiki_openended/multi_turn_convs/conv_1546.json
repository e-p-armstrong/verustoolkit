    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to understand how to retrieve information about identities on the Verus network. Can you explain the `getidentitieswithrevocation` and `getidentity` commands in Verus, and how they help you retrieve information about identities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getidentitieswithrevocation` and `getidentity` commands are indeed essential for retrieving information about identities on the Verus network.\n\n**`getidentitieswithrevocation` Command:**\nThe `getidentitieswithrevocation` command returns an array of matching identities that have revocation authorities. To use this command, you'll need to provide a JSON object with the following parameters:\n- `identityid`: the ID of the identity you want to search for\n- `fromheight` and `toheight`: the block heights within which you want to search for identities\n- `unspent`: a boolean indicating whether to include unspent outputs in the search\n\nThe result is an array of identity objects, each with an additional `txout` member containing the transaction hash and output index.\n\n**`getidentity` Command:**\nThe `getidentity` command returns information about a specific identity on the Verus network. To use this command, you'll need to provide the following arguments:\n- `name@ || iid`: the name or i-address of the identity you want to retrieve\n- `height`: the block height at which you want to retrieve the identity (optional, defaults to the current height)\n- `txproof`: a boolean indicating whether to return a proof of the ID (optional, defaults to false)\n- `txproofheight`: the block height from which to generate the proof (optional, defaults to the specified `height`)\n\nThe result is a JSON object containing information about the identity, including its version, flags, primary addresses, minimum signatures required, identity address, parent ID, name, content map, revocation authority, and recovery authority.\n\nBoth of these commands are useful for retrieving information about identities on the Verus network, which is essential for managing and interacting with identities in the Verus ecosystem.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these commands, or how to use them effectively?",
