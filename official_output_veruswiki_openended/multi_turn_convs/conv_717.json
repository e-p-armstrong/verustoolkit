    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in the possibilities of creating new blockchains. How does Verus support the creation and management of new blockchains, including crowdfunding currency launches, interoperable multichain networks, and decentralized bridge confirmation, and what benefits do these features provide to users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus is designed to empower users with a high degree of flexibility and control when it comes to creating and managing new blockchains. \n\n**Crowdfunding Currency Launches:**\nVerus allows for blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds. This means that users can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on the blockchain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, minus network fees. Additionally, launch options can include maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations.\n\n**Interoperable Multichain Network:**\nVerus features an interoperable, multichain network that enables the creation of an unlimited number of blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, allowing public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains. These private blockchains are easy to set up, with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network, and back. All features and currencies of the public chain are available, but without the access. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.\n\n**Benefits:**\nThe benefits of these features include seamless connectivity between blockchains, with all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. Additionally, the decentralized bridge confirmation provided by Notary IDs ensures that the network is secure and reliable. The unlimited scalability of the Verus network also means that users can create as many blockchains as they need, without worrying about limitations or restrictions.\n\nOverall, Verus provides a powerful and flexible platform for creating and managing new blockchains, with a range of features that enable users to launch and manage their own currencies, and to create interoperable multichain networks that can scale to meet their needs.\n\nDo you have any further questions about creating and managing new blockchains on Verus, or any of the features I mentioned?",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access.
