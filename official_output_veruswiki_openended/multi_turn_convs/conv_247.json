    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about PBaaS blockchains on Verus, and I'm curious to know more. How do they work, and what features do they offer in terms of DeFi AMM conversions, currency validation, and fundraising?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPBaaS blockchains on Verus are truly innovative, and I'd be happy to explain them in detail.\n\nOn Verus, PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) blockchains are fully independent, merge mineable, and rent-free. These blockchains offer several features that set them apart from other blockchain solutions.\n\n**DeFi AMM Conversions:**\nAll DeFi AMM (Automated Market Maker) conversions on Verus PBaaS blockchains are verified via mining and staking as part of the L1 consensus protocol. This means that all conversions in a single liquidity basket are calculated simultaneously for all transactions in any given block. As a result, all participants receive the same price in all directions of conversion. The conversion fee is minimal, ranging from 0.025% to 0.05%.\n\n**Currency Validation:**\nOn Verus PBaaS blockchains, all currencies and identities are primitives at L1 and are validated and verified on UTXO transactions. This means that all inputs and outputs are checked, just like single-currency L1 blockchain transactions, such as those on Ethereum or Bitcoin.\n\n**Interoperability:**\nAll currencies on all independent connected chains, once launched, can be sent back and forth to other multi-currency capable networks, including other independent PBaaS chains and Ethereum as ERC20s.\n\n**Mapped Currencies:**\nVerus also allows for \"mapped currencies\", which map 1:1 to an existing currency on Ethereum (e.g., DAI). These mapped currencies can be sent from Ethereum with simple transactions and received and used as the new mapped currency, or sent back to Ethereum and used there as the original currency.\n\n**Fundraising Options:**\nCurrency launches on Verus PBaaS blockchains can raise funds in three ways. Each of these fundraising options creates a currency that is not 100% backed, and its price responds to market forces. The three fundraising options are:\n\n1. Fractionally backed currencies, which result from fundraising or endowing launch grants/pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, whether time-locked or not. These currencies take their funding from a percentage of the reserve backing.\n2. 100% backed currencies, which do not change their relative price to the underlying basket reserve when they are converted to or from reserves.\n3. New blockchain launches, which create new native currency for operating the proof of stake of the blockchain.\n\nOverall, Verus PBaaS blockchains offer a range of features that make them a powerful tool for building decentralized applications and creating new currencies. Do you have any further questions about PBaaS blockchains or their features?",
