    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to get a better understanding of VerusIDs. Can you explain what they are and what their key benefits are?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to explain VerusIDs and their benefits in detail.\n\nVerusIDs are not just an ID system, but a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides true self-sovereign identities. They offer several key benefits, including:\n\n**Quantum-ready Friendly Crypto Addresses:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, with the ability to control these transactions using single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or properties are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity will follow the updated spend conditions and be subject to the updated keys. Additionally, VerusIDs are resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms, and a quantum secure signature scheme will be integrated in the future, allowing for retroactive quantum resistance.\n\n**Fully Decentralized:** VerusIDs are fully decentralized, meaning anyone can create one and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without needing permission. The costs of creating an ID are distributed to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\n\n**Other Key Benefits:** VerusIDs can also be used to publish ID -> destination address mappings on other blockchains, and they offer unique features such as revocation, recovery, and inheritance of funds in existing UTXOs, which are exclusive to the Verus ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, VerusIDs provide a powerful, decentralized, and secure way to manage identities and transactions, with a range of benefits that set them apart from traditional ID systems.\n\nDo you have any further questions about VerusIDs or their benefits?",

            "VerusIDs are true self-sovereign identities and aren't simply an ID system as much as a fully functional blockchain protocol. There is no business in the protocol, but plenty of opportunity for those who use what it can do for identity applications. Verus ID provides:**Quantum ready** friendly crypto addresses on the worldwide Verus network -- VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID -> destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.**Fully decentralized** -- anyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.",
