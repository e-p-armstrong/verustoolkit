    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in using multi-currency support in Verus, but I want to make sure I'm aware of any potential limitations that might impact my experience. Can you walk me through some of the limitations I should be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen working with multi-currency support in Verus, there are some limitations to be aware of to ensure a smooth experience. These limitations are important to understand as they can impact how you interact with the platform.\n\n**Limitation 1: Avoid Using i-Addresses as ID Names**\nOne crucial limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. To avoid potential issues, it's recommended to avoid making an ID with an i-address as its name.\n\n**Limitation 2: Currency Naming Conflicts in the GUI (Temporary Errata)**\nAnother limitation, currently considered errata, is that if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you won't be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is temporary and will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\n**Disclaimer and Licensing Information**\nIt's essential to note that the software is experimental and unfinished, and users should be aware of the risks involved. The licensing terms allow for free use, modification, and distribution of the software, subject to certain conditions, including the inclusion of the copyright notice and permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n\nBy understanding these limitations and terms, you can effectively utilize the multi-currency features in Verus while avoiding potential pitfalls.\n\nDo you have any questions about these limitations or would you like more information on how to navigate them?",

            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!
