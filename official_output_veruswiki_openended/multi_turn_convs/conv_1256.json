    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I want to configure pool-mining on Windows to run on low priority, so that it doesn't interfere with other processes running on my PC. Can you walk me through the steps for Verus NHEQminer and Verus CCMiner?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo configure pool-mining on Windows to run on low priority, you need to adjust the batch file of your mining software to run the miner executable with the `/Low` priority flag. This will allow your PC to throttle down the mining process whenever it needs processing power for other tasks.\n\nHere are the specific steps for Verus NHEQminer and Verus CCMiner:\n\n**Verus NHEQminer:**\n\n1. Download and extract the Verus NHEQminer software to a preferred location on your Windows PC.\n2. Open the `start.bat` file in a text editor and scroll down to the line that starts the miner executable.\n3. Modify the line to include the `/Low` priority flag, so that it looks like this:\n```\n%windir%\\system32\\cmd.exe /c start \"NHEQminer VRSC\" /Low \"%THIS_DIR%\\nheqminer.exe\" -v -l %PoolHost%:%Port% -u %PublicVerusCoinAddress%.%WorkerName% -t %Threads% %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9\n```\n4. Save and exit the file.\n5. Run the `start.bat` file to start mining on low priority.\n\n**Verus CCMiner:**\nUnfortunately, I don't have the specific steps for Verus CCMiner, but the process is likely similar to Verus NHEQminer. If you need help with that, I can try to find more information or you can try following the same steps as for Verus NHEQminer.\n\nBy following these steps, you can configure your pool-mining software to run on low priority, allowing you to use CPU-heavy applications like games without the miner interfering. Note that this method is not recommended for solo-mining setups, and is best suited for pool-mining.\n\nDo you have any further questions about configuring pool-mining on low priority or any other mining-related topics?",

            "# Windows pool-mining on low priority.## Links to VRSC miners:[Miners download page](https://verus.io/getVRSC.html)## Procedure:In order to let your mining not interfere with other processes running on your PC, we'll need to deprioritize\nthe mining process. This will result in your miner throttling down whenever your PC needs processing power.\nPeople have reported to be able to use CPU-heavy applications, like games, without the miner interfering, with\nthis method.Because the Verus wallet (GUI and CLI) does a lot more than mining, it is not recommended to use this for a\nsolo-mining setup. This is tested on Verus NHEQminer and Verus CCMiner on Windows 10.First thing you will need is pool-mining software. The link is supplied above this procedure. Download your\npreferred miner, extract it to your prefered location and configure the batchfile with the pool of your choice\nand your own mining address.Now we'll need to adjust the batchfile to run on low priority:##### NHEQMINER:- change to the folder you extracted the download\n - edit the `start.bat`\n - Scroll down to the line, that needs to be adjusted:\n   `nheqminer.exe -v -l %PoolHost%:%Port% -u %PublicVerusCoinAddress%.%WorkerName% -t %Threads% %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9`\n - adjust the line so it looks like this:\n   `%windir%\\system32\\cmd.exe /c start \"NHEQminer VRSC\" /Low \"%THIS_DIR%\\nheqminer.exe\" -v -l %PoolHost%:%Port% -u %PublicVerusCoinAddress%.%WorkerName% -t %Threads% %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9`\n - save and exit the file\n - run `start.bat` to start mining##### CCMINER:",
