    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there, I'm using Verus Testnet (VRSCTEST) and I want to upgrade to a new version. What are the necessary steps to take when upgrading, and what kind of disclaimer and license applies to the use of this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUpgrading to a new version of Verus Testnet (VRSCTEST) requires some specific steps to ensure a smooth transition. If you have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current one, you need to delete certain directories before running the new update. The directories to delete vary depending on your operating system.\n\nLet's go through the steps for each operating system:\n\n* If you're on **Linux**, you need to delete the `~/.komodo/vrsctest` directory.\n* If you're on **MacOS**, you need to delete the `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest` directory.\n* If you're on **Windows**, you need to delete the `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` directory.\n\nIt's crucial to follow these steps to avoid any potential issues with the new update.\n\nRegarding the use of this software, it's important to note that it is **experimental and unfinished**. As such, it comes with a disclaimer that you use it at your own risk, and there is no warranty for any kind of damage that may occur.\n\nThe software is licensed under a permissive license, which grants you the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, subject to certain conditions. Specifically, the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nThe license also includes a disclaimer of warranty, which means that the Software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the Software.\n\nDo you have any further questions about upgrading to a new version of Verus Testnet (VRSCTEST) or the license and disclaimer that applies to its use?",
