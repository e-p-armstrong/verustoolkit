    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in using the Verus software, but I want to know what changes I should be aware of and what precautions I should take. Also, how can I access the software for different operating systems?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus software is an experimental and unfinished product, and users should be aware of the risks involved when using it. Despite this, the software has undergone some notable changes that you should be aware of.\n\nOne of the significant changes is the renaming of komodod and komodo-cli to verusd and verus, respectively. Additionally, the wrappers have been removed, and there have been some minor staking improvements, fixes to longest chain reporting and getchaintips bugs, and preparations for PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) technology.\n\nBefore using the software, it's essential to understand that it's provided \"as is\" and without any warranty. You should be cautious when using the software, as it may cause damage to your systems or data. Please use the software at your own risk.\n\nTo access the software, you can download it from the following links for different operating systems:\n\n* MacOS: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/4de5aa22de6d43554f3456abe690c4ca1405e3326748dda14710d85f66634919/detection\n* Linux: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/4f5bc9cc22046b675fea304155026cc2c951ad4760ee5a2e27b42b5db8e4765d/detection\n* Windows: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/787d46b30681e86c20d1875ab3c18c3253168a680c801c64de7a9f43b8b2db2c/detection\n\nPlease note that some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software is related to mining, which can be installed by third parties to exploit users' PCs. For more information on these false positives, you can refer to the provided resources.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that this release does not support the PBaaS testnet. To participate in the PBaaS testnet, you should use the PBaaS Cross-chain Technology Preview, which can be found on the VerusCoin GitHub page.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the Verus software or its usage?",
