    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand some of the commands in Verus, but I'm not quite sure how they work. Can you explain what the `submitmergedblock` and `addnode` commands do, and how to use them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to break down what each of these commands does and how to use them.\n\n**`submitmergedblock` Command:**\nThe `submitmergedblock` command is used to submit one or more new blocks to one or more networks. This command takes two arguments: `hexdata` and an optional `jsonparametersobject`. The `hexdata` argument is a string that contains the hex-encoded block data to submit. The `jsonparametersobject` argument is an optional JSON object that can contain additional parameters for the submission.\n\nWhen you run `submitmergedblock`, Verus will attempt to submit the block to the specified network(s). If the block is valid and meets the target hash for other chains that have been added with `addmergedblock`, Verus will also submit the block to those chains using an RPC `submitmergedblock` request.\n\nThe result of `submitmergedblock` can take one of three forms:\n\n* If the submission is rejected, the result will be a JSON object with a `rejected` key containing the reason for rejection.\n* If the submission is accepted by our chain and PBaaS chains, the result will be a JSON object with a `blockhash` key containing the hash of the submitted block, an `accepted` key set to `true`, and a `pbaas_submissions` key containing a JSON object with the chain IDs and hashes of the submitted blocks for each PBaaS chain.\n* If the submission is accepted by only PBaaS chains, the result will be a JSON object with a `blockhash` key containing the hash of the submitted block, an `accepted` key set to `\"pbaas\"`, and a `pbaas_submissions` key containing a JSON object with the chain IDs and hashes of the submitted blocks for each PBaaS chain.\n\nYou can use `submitmergedblock` from the command line or by sending an RPC request using `curl`.\n\n**`addnode` Command:**\nThe `addnode` command is used to add or remove a node from the addnode list, or to try a connection to a node once. This command takes two arguments: `node` and `command`.\n\nThe `node` argument is a string that specifies the node to add, remove, or try to connect to. You can use the `getpeerinfo` command to get a list of available nodes.\n\nThe `command` argument is a string that specifies the action to take: `'add'` to add the node to the list, `'remove'` to remove the node from the list, or `'onetry'` to try a connection to the node once.\n\nBy using `addnode`, you can manage the list of nodes that Verus connects to and submit blocks to.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these commands, or how to use them in your workflow?",

            "In Verus, there are two important commands: `submitmergedblock` and `addnode`.
