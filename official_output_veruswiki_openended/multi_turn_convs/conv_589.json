    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about signing transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus testnet and mainnet. Could you walk me through the steps?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus testnet and mainnet, you'll need to follow a few steps. I'd be happy to guide you through it.\n\n**Step 1: Create the transaction and get the raw transaction data**\nUse the `verus sendcurrency` command to create a transaction and get the raw transaction data. The format for this command is:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n```\nThis command will return an operation ID, which you can use to check the status of the transaction.\n\n**Step 2: Get the raw hex transaction data**\nUse the `verus z_getoperationstatus` command to get the raw hex transaction data. The format for this command is:\n```\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\nThis command will return the raw hex transaction data, which you can use to sign the transaction.\n\n**Step 3: Sign the transaction**\nTake the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet(s) containing the additional signing addresses/IDs. Use the `verus signrawtransaction` command to sign the transaction. The format for this command is:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\nRepeat this step for each additional signature required.\n\n**Step 4: Broadcast the transaction**\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using the `verus sendrawtransaction` command. The format for this command is:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```\nThis will broadcast the signed transaction on the network.\n\nBy the way, have you heard about the new Verus multicurrency, multichain, DeFi enabled testnet? It's a game-changer. Some key features include:\n\n* Easy GUI for basic operations, as well as command line for more advanced functions\n* Ability to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain, or across blockchains with ease\n* Ability to convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way\n* Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform\n* Accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets\n\nDo you have any questions about the new testnet, or would you like more information on any of these features?",
