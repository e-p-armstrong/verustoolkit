    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to set up my Verus wallet to mine to a specific address using the Verus CLI. Can you walk me through the steps involved in doing so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nSetting up your Verus wallet to mine to a specific address using the Verus CLI is a straightforward process. To help you achieve this, I'll break it down into three easy steps.\n\n**Getting Started**\nTo set up your Verus wallet to mine to a specific address using the Verus CLI, you need to follow three steps.\n\n**Step 1: Get Your Wallet Address**\nFirst, you need to get the wallet address you want to mine to. You can either find an existing address from a previous transaction or create a new one. To find an existing address, use the command `verus listtransactions` and copy the address found after \"address\". Alternatively, you can generate a new wallet address using `verus getnewaddress`.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Your Address and Get Your PubKey**\nNext, use your wallet address to validate it and get your PubKey. You can do this by running the command `verus validateaddress` and copying the long string after \"pubkey\" from the output, without the quotation marks.\n\n**Step 3: Set Your PubKey**\nNow, you need to set your PubKey. You have two options to do this. Option 1 is to add the PubKey to the command line when starting your daemon, by adding the line `-pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED` to the end of your command, just before the \"&\" sign. Option 2 is to edit your `VRSC.conf` file and add the line `pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED`, then start your wallet as usual.\n\n**Important Notes**\nOnce you've set up your PubKey, your mining rewards will be sent to the specified wallet address. It's essential to keep notes and associate the wallet address with the PubKey to ensure you're using the correct information. Double-check that you've validated the correct PubKey for the wallet address to avoid any errors.\n\nDo you have any questions about these steps, or would you like further clarification on any of them?",

            "## In Verus CLI\nStep 1 - First get your wallet address you want to mine to:\nYou can find an address if you already have previous transactions, or you can create a new one.

From the output find the long string after \"pubkey\", copy without the quotation marks.\n\nStep 3 - Set your PubKey\n* Option 1: use this pubkey when starting your daemon by adding the following line to the end of your command, just before the \"&\" sign: -pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED\n* Option 2: edit your `VRSC.conf` and add the line `pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED`. Then start your whallet as you are used to.\n\nYour rewards will now be mined to that address. It would be a good idea to keep notes and associate the wallet address with the pubkey...also to double check that you did validate the correct pubkey for the wallet address, making sure you made no errors.\n\n(submitted by @Oliver Westbrook, edited by Oink.vrsc@)\n\nnote: last revision date 2020-02-24.",
