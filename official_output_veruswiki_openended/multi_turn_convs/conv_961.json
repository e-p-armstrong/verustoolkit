    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm interested in learning more about the Verus network. Can you explain some of the advanced features, including private blockchains, ID locking and unlocking, and conversion queries, and how you use them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus network offers several advanced features that make it a powerful and flexible platform for blockchain applications.\n\nThe Verus network is designed to be highly customizable and adaptable to different use cases, and these advanced features are a big part of what makes it so powerful.\n\n**Private Blockchains:**\nOne of the key features of Verus is the ability to create private, internal blockchains that can easily bridge public currencies into an organization's private network and back. This allows organizations to have a private blockchain with all the features and currencies of the public chain, but with restricted access. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate on the Verus network, allowing for a fractal model of unlimited, simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n\n**Locking and Unlocking IDs:**\nVerus also provides advanced ID management features, including the ability to lock and unlock IDs. There are two types of locks: time locks and time delays. A time lock defines the unlock height of the identity, and a time delay defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. IDs can be updated using the `updateidentity` command, specifying the lock type and parameters. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. However, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**Conversion Queries:**\nVerus also provides a powerful API for conversion queries, which allows users to retrieve information about currencies that meet certain liquidity and reserve ratio thresholds. The `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. For example, you can use the command `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` to retrieve all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\nThese advanced features of the Verus network make it a versatile and powerful platform for a wide range of blockchain applications, from private internal blockchains to advanced ID management and conversion queries.\n\nDo you have any questions about these features or how to use them?",

            " well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n#### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\n The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nWill return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
