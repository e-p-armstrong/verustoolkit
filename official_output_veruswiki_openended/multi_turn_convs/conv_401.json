    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand how to merge UTXOs and notes in Verus, but I'm not quite sure what arguments I need to provide or how they work. Can you explain what's required and how it all fits together?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMerging UTXOs and notes can be a bit complex, but don't worry, I'm here to help. To merge UTXOs and notes in Verus, there are several arguments that need to be provided. Here's a breakdown of each argument and how they work:\n\n**1. fromaddresses (array, required)**: This argument is an array of addresses from which to merge UTXOs and notes. You can specify multiple addresses, including special strings like \"ANY_TADDR\", \"ANY_SPROUT\", and \"ANY_SAPLING\", which allow you to merge UTXOs from any t-addrs, Sprout zaddrs, and Sapling zaddrs belonging to the wallet, respectively. Note that you cannot send funds from both Sprout and Sapling addresses simultaneously.\n\n**2. toaddress (string, required)**: This is the t-addr or zaddr to which the merged funds will be sent.\n\n**3. fee (numeric, optional, default=0.0001)**: This is the fee amount to attach to the transaction. If not specified, it defaults to 0.0001.\n\n**4. transparent_limit (numeric, optional, default=50)**: This argument sets a limit on the maximum number of UTXOs to merge. If set to 0, it will use the node option -mempooltxinputlimit (before Overwinter) or merge as many UTXOs as will fit in the transaction (after Overwinter).\n\n**5. shielded_limit (numeric, optional, default=20 Sprout or 200 Sapling Notes)**: This argument sets a limit on the maximum number of notes to merge. If set to 0, it will merge as many notes as will fit in the transaction.\n\n**6. memo (string, optional)**: This is an optional memo field that can be encoded as hex. When the toaddress is a zaddr, this memo will be stored in the memo field of the new note.\n\nBy providing these arguments, you can merge UTXOs and notes in Verus, making it easier to manage your funds and reduce the number of UTXOs and notes in your wallet.\n\nDo you have any questions about these arguments or how to use them to merge UTXOs and notes?",

            "#### Arguments:\n1. fromaddresses     (array, required) A JSON array with addresses.\n             The following special strings are accepted inside the array:\n               - \"ANY_TADDR\":  Merge UTXOs from any t-addrs belonging to the wallet.\n               - \"ANY_SPROUT\": Merge notes from any Sprout zaddrs belonging to the wallet.\n               - \"ANY_SAPLING\": Merge notes from any Sapling zaddrs belonging to the wallet.\n             While it is possible to use a variety of different combinations of addresses and the above values,\n             it is not possible to send funds from both sprout and sapling addresses simultaneously.
