    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still getting familiar with the Verus CLI commands. Can you please explain the output of the `signrawtransaction` command in Verus, and how can I use it to sign a raw transaction? Additionally, how can I create a multi-signature address using the `createmultisig` command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `signrawtransaction` command in Verus is a powerful tool for signing raw transactions. \n\nThe output of this command is a JSON object that contains the following information:\n\n* `hex`: The hex-encoded raw transaction with signature(s)\n* `complete`: A boolean indicating whether the transaction has a complete set of signatures\n* `errors`: An array of objects containing script verification errors (if there are any)\n\nEach error object in the `errors` array contains information about the error, including:\n* `txid`: The hash of the referenced, previous transaction\n* `vout`: The index of the output to be spent and used as input\n* `scriptSig`: The hex-encoded signature script\n* `sequence`: The script sequence number\n* `error`: The verification or signing error related to the input\n\nTo use the `signrawtransaction` command to sign a raw transaction, you can simply provide the hex-encoded raw transaction as an argument. For example:\n```bash\n> verus signrawtransaction \"myhex\"\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the JSON-RPC interface to sign a raw transaction by sending a JSON request to the Verus server. For example:\n```bash\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"signrawtransaction\", \"params\": [\"myhex\"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nNow, regarding the `createmultisig` command, it's used to create multi-signature addresses. This command takes two arguments: `nrequired` and an array of public keys. It returns a JSON object with the multi-signature address and redeemScript.\n\nThe `createmultisig` command allows you to create a multi-signature address that requires `nrequired` signatures out of a total of `m` keys. For example:\n```\n> verus createmultisig 2 [\"key1\", \"key2\", \"key3\"]\n```\nThis would create a multi-signature address that requires 2 signatures out of a total of 3 keys.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these commands or how to use them in your workflow?",
