    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating a new token on the Verus network. How do I launch a new token, such as GOLD, and how can I convert VRSCTEST to GOLD or create a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLaunching a new token on the Verus network involves a few steps. To launch a new token, such as GOLD, you need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending a transaction to initiate the launch. The launch will start 50 blocks after the transaction is made, and it requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch successfully.\n\nThe launch process is part of the mining process, and miners who participate in the launch by mining the blocks that launch the currency will earn 0.025% conversion fees in the form of VRSCTEST converted to GOLD.\n\nBefore the block where the GOLD token launches, you can send a command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, which will effectively park the conversion until the token launches. The command to do this is:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will convert 100 VRSCTEST to GOLD at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD, and you will either receive 0.975 GOLD in your wallet or get your VRSCTEST back if the launch is unsuccessful.\n\nAfter the GOLD token launches, you can create a new token, such as mycoin, that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. To do this, you can use the `definecurrency` command to define the properties of mycoin, including the currencies it can be converted to and the conversion rates.\n\nDo you have any more questions about launching a new token or converting between tokens on the Verus network?",
