    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand the details of a transaction on the Verus network. What information is provided by Verus about a transaction, and what does each piece of information represent?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides a comprehensive set of information about a transaction, which can be categorized into several key fields. These fields provide detailed information about the transaction, including its origin, destination, timing, and other relevant details.\n\nThe information provided by Verus about a transaction includes:\n\n1. **Category**: This field indicates the type of transaction, which can be either 'end', 'eceive', or 'ove'. The category determines the direction of the funds flow.\n\n2. **Amount**: This field shows the amount of VRSC involved in the transaction. For 'eceive' and inbound 'ove' transactions, the amount is positive. For 'end' transactions, the amount is negative.\n\n3. **Vout**: This field represents the vout value of the transaction.\n\n4. **Fee**: This field shows the transaction fee in VRSC, which is only available for 'end' transactions and is always negative.\n\n5. **Confirmations**: This field indicates the number of confirmations the transaction has received, which is available for both 'end' and 'eceive' transactions.\n\n6. **Blockhash**: This field provides the block hash containing the transaction, which is available for both 'end' and 'eceive' transactions.\n\n7. **Blockindex**: This field indicates the block index containing the transaction, which is available for both 'end' and 'eceive' transactions.\n\n8. **Blocktime**: This field shows the block time in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, GMT).\n\n9. **Txid**: This field provides the transaction ID, which is available for both 'end' and 'eceive' transactions.\n\n10. **Time**: This field shows the transaction time in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, GMT).\n\n11. **Timereceived**: This field indicates the time the transaction was received in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, GMT), which is available for both 'end' and 'eceive' transactions.\n\n12. **Comment**: This field contains any comment associated with the transaction.\n\n13. **To**: This field contains any comment \"to\" associated with the transaction.\n\nAdditionally, Verus also provides information about the last block in the chain, including its hash, which is represented by the **Lastblock** field.\n\nAll these fields provide a comprehensive overview of a transaction, enabling users to track and monitor their transactions effectively.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these fields or how to interpret them?",
