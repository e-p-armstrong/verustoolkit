    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got a couple of questions about using Verus software. What's the warranty and liability policy for it, and how should I handle warnings from antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGreat questions! The warranty and liability policy for Verus software is that it is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that the authors and copyright holders of Verus software are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n\nRegarding warnings from antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky, it's possible that they may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because Verus software includes mining functionality, which can be used to exploit a user's PC if installed by a third party. However, these warnings are false positives, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to understand more about these warnings.\n\nIt's important to note that Verus software is designed to be used by individuals who intentionally install it for its intended purpose, such as mining or participating in the Verus network. If you have intentionally installed Verus software and are aware of its functionality, you can safely ignore these warnings from antivirus software.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the warranty and liability policy, or how to handle antivirus warnings?",
