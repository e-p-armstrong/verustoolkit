    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question. What are the steps to download and verify the authenticity of the Verus CLI binary file for ARM64 architecture?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo download and verify the authenticity of the Verus CLI binary file for ARM64 architecture, you need to follow these steps:\n\nFirst, let's break it down into smaller steps. **Step 1: Navigate to the Verus CLI directory**\nFirst, navigate to the directory where the Verus daemon binary file is located. By default, this is in the home directory, specifically in the `verus-cli` subdirectory. You can do this using the `cd` command: `cd verus-cli`.\n\n**Step 2: Check if the Verus daemon is running**\nNext, check if the Verus daemon is running. You can do this by running the `top` command, which will display a list of currently running processes. Look for `verusd` in the list. If it's not running, you can start it by running `./verusd`.\n\n**Step 3: Download the latest ARM64 version**\nDownload the latest ARM64 version of the Verus CLI binary file from the official Verus website or GitHub releases page. Make sure to check the version number and update it accordingly.\n\n**Step 4: Unpack the downloaded file**\nUnpack the downloaded file using the `tar` command: `tar -xvf Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tgz`. This will extract the signature file and the binaries tar/zipped file.\n\n**Step 5: Check the unpacked files and open the signature file**\nCheck that the files have been unpacked successfully by running `ls -la`. Then, open the signature file by running `cat Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-3-arm64.tar.gz.signature.txt-file`. This will display the signature information to verify the downloaded file's authenticity.\n\n**Step 6: Verify the signature**\nFinally, verify the signature using the `verifyfile` command: `./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"[signature string from signature.txt-file]\" [your home directory file path]Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tar.gz`. Make sure to replace the signature string and file path with the actual values. If the signature is valid, the command should return `true`. If you encounter issues, try adding quotes around the file path.\n\nDo you have any questions about these steps, or would you like me to clarify anything?",

            "1. Navigate to the directory which contains the verus daemon binary file (the default is in the home directory - ie ~/verus-cli)\n    cd verus-cli\n2. Check the Verus daemon is running - you will need to keep it running to check the downloaded file's signature\n    top\n  (`verusd` should appear as one of the processes in the list. If you need to start it use the command `./verusd`.)\n3. Download the latest ARM64 version. Check https://verus.io/wallet/command-wallet\n  (The commands below are for v0.7.3-10) Don't forget to change the version number to whichever one you are updating.\n    wget https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/download/v0.7.3-10/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tgz\n4. unpack/unzip the download into the signature file and the binaries tar/zipped file\n    tar -xvf Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tgz\n5. Check it has unpacked/unzipped & open the signature file\n    ls -la\n    cat Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-3-arm64.tar.gz.signature.txt-file\n  This will display the signature information to verify the downloaded file is authentic.6. CHECK the signature by using the data in the signature file\n    ./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"[signature string from signature.txt-file]\" [your home directory file path]Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-10-arm64.tar.gz\n  The return should be **`true`**.
