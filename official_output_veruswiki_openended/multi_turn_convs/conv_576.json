    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm trying to get a better understanding of Verus configuration files and creating identities with fractional currencies as their parents. Can you help me with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that. \n\nFirst, let's talk about where the configuration files for Verus are stored on different operating systems. \n\n**Configuration Files:**\nThe configuration files for Verus are stored in different locations depending on the operating system you are using. Here are the locations for each operating system:\n\n* On Linux, the configuration files are stored in `~/.Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`.\n* On Mac OS, the configuration files are stored in `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`.\n* On Windows 10, the configuration files are stored in `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`, or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`.\n\nNow, let's move on to creating an identity with a fractional currency as its parent using the `registernamecommitment` and `registeridentity` commands.\n\n**Creating an Identity with a Fractional Currency as its Parent:**\nTo create an identity with a fractional currency as its parent, you need to use the `registernamecommitment` and `registeridentity` commands.\n\nThe `registernamecommitment` command takes two more positional arguments to specify a currency parent and a funding address. You can use quotes `\"\"` to leave fields blank. For example, to specify a parent currency `vrsc-btc` but no referrer, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment subID RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr \"\" vrsc-btc zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny\n```\nNext, you need to specify the parent in the identity definition. You can do this by using the `registeridentity` command with the following format:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' false 0 sourceoffunds\n```\nIn this command, `returntx` is set to `false` to sign and submit the ID registration, `feeoffer` is set to `0` to use the default fee, and `sourceoffunds` is the funding identity, transparent address, or z-address.\n\nDo you have any more questions about Verus configuration files or creating identities with fractional currencies as their parents?",
