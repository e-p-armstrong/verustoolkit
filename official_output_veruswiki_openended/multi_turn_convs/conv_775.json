    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard about the Verus ID and VerusHash 2.1 Network Upgrade, but I'm not entirely sure what it's all about. Can you explain what this upgrade is and what new features and technologies it brings to the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus ID and VerusHash 2.1 Network Upgrade is a significant upgrade to the Verus network, and I'd be happy to break it down for you.\n\nThis upgrade is fully ready for testing on both the VRSCTEST testnet and VRSC mainnet, and it brings two major technology upgrades to the table.\n\nThe first upgrade is an improvement to the FPGA-equalizing hash algorithm, which enhances the overall security and performance of the network.\n\nThe second upgrade is the introduction of Verus ID, a revolutionary, decentralized identity technology that provides a fully decentralized, self-sovereign digital identity system. Verus ID is designed to disrupt traditional centralized systems by providing a secure, quantum-ready, and private identity management solution.\n\nVerus ID includes several key features, such as:\n\n* Built-in privacy through the integration of zk-SNARKs, which enables users to prove things about themselves without revealing more information than necessary.\n* Improved blockchain address security, which makes it possible to recover lost funds even after losing private keys.\n* Protection against identity and key theft, ensuring that users have full control over their digital identities.\n* Inheritance features, which allow users to transfer assets to heirs in a secure and decentralized manner.\n\nOverall, the Verus ID and VerusHash 2.1 Network Upgrade is a significant milestone in the development of the Verus network, and it brings a wide range of benefits and features to users.\n\nDo you have any more questions about this upgrade, or would you like me to elaborate on any of the features I mentioned?",

It is considered fully ready for testing on both VRSCTEST testnet and VRSC mainnet. While this release is likely to work fine on mainnet through the coming activation, it is not yet an official release that you should expect to support mainnet activation. If you install this version, please make sure to upgrade to an official release before network activation, which will happen at block 800200, expected to be mined or staked on December 15th.\nThis release enables two technology upgrades, one that would be considered big news to most cryptocurrency projects, an improvement to the FPGA-equalizing hash algorithm, and a revolutionary, new decentralized identity technology, Verus IDs, that will disrupt today\u2019s centralized systems with the most secure, quantum ready, fully decentralized, self-sovereign digital identity system in the world.\n## Verus ID\nVerus ID includes built-in privacy at the core through integration of zk-SNARKs, and provides a revolutionary improvement to blockchain address security, making it possible to actually recover your money after losing your keys, secure against identity and key theft, prove things about yourself without having to show more details than needed, and transfer assets to heirs as part of",
