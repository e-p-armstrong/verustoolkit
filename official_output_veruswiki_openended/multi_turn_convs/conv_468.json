    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about the advanced features of the Verus multichain network. Can you tell me about its support for token launches, interoperable blockchains, and ID locking/unlocking mechanisms, and how these features can be utilized using VerusIDs and commands?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multichain network offers several advanced features that enable token launches, interoperable blockchains, and ID locking/unlocking mechanisms. These features can be utilized using VerusIDs and commands to create a robust and secure ecosystem.\n\nLet me break down each of these features for you:\n\n**Token Launches:**\nVerus supports token launches with features such as carve-outs of proceeds, pre-launch discounts for early participants, and vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs. This allows for a flexible and customizable token launch process.\n\n**Interoperable Blockchains:**\nThe Verus multichain network enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, each with its own Notary IDs that provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This allows for public blockchains to be merge-mined and staked, as well as private, internal blockchains that can be easily set up with bridging of public currencies. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.\n\n**ID Locking and Unlocking:**\nVerusIDs can be locked and unlocked using commands such as `setidentitytimelock` and `setunlockdelay`. Time locking allows an ID to be locked until a specified block height, while time delay sets a delay for an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, and a locked identity! cannot revoke itself.\n\n**Conversion Queries:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve and are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio. This allows for easy querying of conversion rates and reserve ratios.\n\nOverall, the Verus multichain network provides a robust and flexible ecosystem for token launches, interoperable blockchains, and ID locking/unlocking mechanisms, enabling a wide range of use cases and applications.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these features, or how to utilize them using VerusIDs and commands?",

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n#### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n The unlockatblock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\": <Unlock block height>}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\n The setunlockdelay parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"setunlockdelay\": <Unlock block delay>}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve rati",
