    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with importing viewing keys and wallets in Verus. Can you explain what the `z_importviewingkey` and `z_importwallet` commands are used for, and how they can be used to import viewing keys and wallets, respectively?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `z_importviewingkey` and `z_importwallet` commands are essential tools in Verus for managing shielded addresses and wallets.\n\n**`z_importviewingkey` Command:**\nThe `z_importviewingkey` command is used to import a viewing key in Verus. A viewing key is a key that allows you to view the transactions and balances of a shielded address. The command takes four arguments: the viewing key (`vkey`), an optional `rescan` argument, an optional `startHeight` argument, and an optional `zaddr` argument.\n\n* The `vkey` argument is required and specifies the viewing key to be imported.\n* The `rescan` argument is optional and specifies whether to rescan the wallet for transactions after importing the viewing key. It can be set to \"yes\", \"no\", or \"whenkeyisnew\", with \"whenkeyisnew\" being the default.\n* The `startHeight` argument is optional and specifies the block height to start the rescan from, with 0 being the default.\n* The `zaddr` argument is optional and specifies the z-addr in case of importing the viewing key for a Sapling address.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `z_importviewingkey` command:\n```bash\n> verus z_importviewingkey \"vkey\"\n> verus z_importviewingkey \"vkey\" no\n> verus z_importviewingkey \"vkey\" whenkeyisnew 30000\n> verus z_importviewingkey \"vkey\" yes 20000\n> verus z_importviewingkey \"vkey\" no 0 \"zaddr\"\n```\nThe command can also be used as a JSON-RPC call.\n\n**`z_importwallet` Command:**\nThe `z_importwallet` command is used to import t-addr and z-addr keys from a wallet export file in Verus. The command takes one argument: the filename of the wallet export file.\n\nHere are some examples of how to use the `z_importwallet` command:\n```bash\n> verus z_exportwallet \"nameofbackup\"\n> verus z_importwallet \"path/to/exportdir/nameofbackup\"\n```\nThe command can also be used as a JSON-RPC call.\n\nIn summary, the `z_importviewingkey` command is used to import a viewing key, while the `z_importwallet` command is used to import a wallet export file. Both commands are useful for managing shielded addresses and wallets in Verus.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these commands, or would you like more information on how to use them?",
