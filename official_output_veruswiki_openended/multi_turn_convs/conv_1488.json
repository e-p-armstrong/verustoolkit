    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about Verus ID and how it addresses some of the fundamental issues in traditional blockchain systems. Can you tell me more about it? Specifically, how does it handle decentralized identity management and quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus ID is a blockchain identity technology that provides an elegant solution to the fundamental problems of traditional blockchain systems. Specifically, it addresses the issues of decentralized identity management and quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses.\n\nIn traditional blockchain systems, users face the risks of losing access to their funds if they lose their private keys. This is because the concept of \"not your keys, not your coins\" means that if you don't have control over your private keys, you don't have control over your funds. Additionally, the trade-off between decentralized, censorship-resistant public systems and the risk of losing access to funds is a fundamental issue in blockchain systems today.\n\nVerus ID solves these problems by providing self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable identities. This means that users have full control over their identities and funds, and can recover their access if needed. The technology also provides quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses, which ensures that users' identities and funds are secure even in the face of quantum computing threats.\n\nOne of the key advantages of Verus ID is that it integrates identity and currency address into one. This means that users can use their friendly name as both a reference to who they are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer. This simplifies the process of sending and receiving funds, and makes it easier for users to manage their identities and funds.\n\nOverall, Verus ID provides a robust and secure solution for decentralized identity management and quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses. Do you have any more questions about Verus ID or how it addresses these issues?",

Mainnet use is still being tested.\n# Verus ID - A Better Blockchain Identity Technology\nIf you\u2019ve been around crypto for even a little while, you\u2019ll start to hear things like \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d, \u201close your keys, lose your coins\u201d. If you lose your keys, no one will ever be able to recover your money.In fact, trading off decentralized, censorship resistant public systems for this risk to your cryptocurrency assets is such a fundamental issue in blockchain systems today that it is considered an acceptable price for having the benefit of full control over your own funds and blockchain assets.Verus ID provides an elegant solution to these previously unsolved, fundamental problems, and also provides quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses as self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities that provide the following advantages over today\u2019s blockchain systems:1. Identity and currency address are one and the same. Your friendly name can be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer.\n2. Each ide",
