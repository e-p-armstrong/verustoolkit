    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm about to download the Verus software, and I want to make sure I do it securely. Can you walk me through the steps to verify the downloads, and also tell me a bit about the v0.9.9 release? I've heard it's a big deal.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerifying downloads of Verus software involves a few steps to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the downloaded files. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n**Verifying Downloads:**\n\n1. **Extract the downloaded archive**: First, extract the contents of the downloaded archive file.\n2. **Verify the signature**: Using the extracted text file, verify the signature of the extracted archive using the command `./verus verifyfile`. This command takes three arguments: the identity of the signer (in this case, \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\"), the signature, and the path to the file to be verified.\n3. **Extract the archive to the desired directory**: Once the signature is verified, you can safely extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\n**CLI Examples:**\nThere are two ways to verify the signature: directly using the `verifyfile` command or using a checksum with the `verifyhash` command.\n\n**Verifying File Directly:**\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AVBfJQABQSAcInXeVZTA3kTri4vGTRQjZwceXzhrMY6bMy+vLatPSjONfaXXrDU6N2sHsiYqNuHRs+vzm9brZDmk1NlqNdNl\" \"/Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.9-1-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.9-1-x86_64.tar.gz\"\n```\n**Verifying Using a Checksum:**\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AVBfJQABQSAcInXeVZTA3kTri4vGTRQjZwceXzhrMY6bMy+vLatPSjONfaXXrDU6N2sHsiYqNuHRs+vzm9brZDmk1NlqNdNl\" 3bda41e7f53ab13a0f75a45514974a20d7ca470c1ccb9fcbb9743c02c68e3642\n```\nThe result will be `true` if the signature is valid.\n\n**v0.9.9 Release:**\nThe v0.9.9 release is a significant update that prepares the network for the mainnet PBaaS release. Here are some key points to note:\n\n1. **MANDATORY UPGRADE**: v0.9.9 is a mandatory upgrade, meaning that you need to upgrade to this release to stay reliably connected to the mainnet after the first preparatory PBaaS upgrade is triggered.\n2. **Preparing for PBaaS Mainnet Launch**: This release is a crucial step towards the mainnet PBaaS launch, and it's essential to upgrade to v0.9.9 as soon as possible to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nDo you have any questions about the verification process or the v0.9.9 release? It's important to get it right to ensure your security and connectivity to the mainnet.",

Key points:1. **Preparing for #LaunchPBaaS**: v0.9.9 is MANDATORY, meaning that you will need to upgrade to this release ASAP to stay reliably connected to mainnet after the first preparatory PBaaS upgrade is triggered, both for testnet and mainnet. While the current deadline for being upgraded is in 1 week, it is a soft fork that we would like to activate as soon as possible, and if we can believe that we have more than 50% of the validating network updated earlier than 1 week, we will trigger the activation with our Oracle Notification Technology described in 2. **(Mainnet + Testnet)**",
