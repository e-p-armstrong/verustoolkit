    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus, and I'm also curious about how to define a new currency using the `definecurrency` command. Can you walk me through the different ways to use `sendcurrency` and how to define a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus provides a versatile way to send and convert funds between different addresses and currencies. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\n**Sending Funds:** You can use `sendcurrency` to send funds from a single address to another single address. For instance, to send 10 VRSCTEST from `bob@` to `alice@`, you would use the command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nYou can also send funds from all wallet funds to multiple recipients. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST to both `alice@` and `bob@`, you would use:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Converting Currencies:** The `sendcurrency` API also allows you to convert funds from one currency to another. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to TESTCOIN, you would use:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"TESTCOIN\"}]'\n```\n**Preconverting to a New Currency:** If you want to preconvert funds to a new currency before it is active, you can use the `preconvert` option. For example, to preconvert 10 VRSCTEST to NEWCOIN and refund the amount to `alice@` if the conversion is not successful, you would use:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\nNow, let's talk about defining a new currency using the `definecurrency` command. To create a new currency, you need to define it using this command. The controller of the ID with the same name as the currency is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. For example, to define a currency called \"gold\" with specific options and conversion rates, you would use:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency called \"gold\" with specific properties, such as conversion rates and preallocation of funds.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using `sendcurrency` or defining a new currency with `definecurrency`?",

The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start.
