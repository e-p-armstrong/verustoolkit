    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been exploring the multi-currency features in Verus, and I was wondering if there are any limitations or important notes I should be aware of. Additionally, what kind of license does the software operate under?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen working with multi-currency features in Verus, there are a few things to keep in mind.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\nThere are two key limitations to be aware of:\n\n1. **ID Names and i-Addresses:** Be cautious when creating IDs with names that are also i-addresses. Although the protocol does not prevent this, it can cause problems when referring to currencies or IDs using their i-addresses or names. To avoid confusion, it is recommended to avoid using i-addresses as ID names.\n\n2. **Currency Names in Verus Desktop:** Currently, if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop (such as BTC or ETH), you cannot use the same name for a PBaaS chain. This is a temporary limitation and will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\n**License:**\n\nThe Verus software operates under a permissive free software license. This license allows users to:\n\n* Use the software without restrictions\n* Copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software\n* Permit others to whom the software is furnished to do so\n\nThe only conditions are that the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. This license ensures that users have the freedom to use and modify the software as needed.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these limitations or the license? Or would you like more information on how to work with multi-currency features in Verus?",

            "#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.### DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
