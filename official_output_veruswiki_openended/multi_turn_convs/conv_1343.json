    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been trying to figure out how to use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds on the Verus testnet. Can you walk me through how to use it and provide some examples?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert funds on the Verus testnet. Here's how you can use it:\n\nThe `sendcurrency` API allows you to send funds by specifying the sender's address, the recipient's address, the currency being sent, and the amount. The basic format for sending funds is:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"sender_address\" '[{\"currency\":\"currency_code\",\"address\":\"recipient_address\",\"amount\":amount}]'\n```\nLet me provide some examples to make it clearer.\n\n**Example 1: Sending VRSCTEST from a single address**\nLet's say you want to send 10 VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@). You would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Example 2: Sending VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients**\nYou can also send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients. For example, let's say you want to send 10 VRSCTEST to two recipients with friendly-name z-addresses (alice@:private and bob@:private). You would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Important Note:**\nRemember that all testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. So, be sure to use the testnet for testing purposes only.\n\nBy using the `sendcurrency` API, you can easily send and convert funds on the Verus testnet. Just remember to replace the placeholders with your actual addresses and amounts, and you're good to go!\n\nDo you have any questions about using the `sendcurrency` API, or would you like more examples?",
