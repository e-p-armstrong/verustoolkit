    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm about to update to a new version of Verus testnet (VRSCTEST) and I want to make sure I do it correctly to avoid any potential issues. Can you walk me through the necessary steps and also let me know what kind of disclaimer I should be aware of when using this software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen updating to a new version of Verus testnet (VRSCTEST), it's crucial to delete the VRSCTEST directories from your system to ensure a smooth transition. This is because the testnet was deleted and relaunched, and using an old version of VRSCTEST may cause issues.\n\nTo delete the VRSCTEST directories, follow these steps:\n\n* On Linux, delete the `~/.komodo/vrsctest` directory.\n* On MacOS, delete the `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest` directory.\n* On Windows, delete the `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` directory.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\nPlease note that Verus testnet (VRSCTEST) is experimental and unfinished software, and you use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage that may occur.\n\nThe software is provided \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, whether express or implied. The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software.\n\nIt's essential to understand that Verus testnet (VRSCTEST) is still in development, and you should be aware of the risks involved when using it. However, by following the necessary steps and being aware of the disclaimer, you can minimize potential issues and contribute to the development of the Verus ecosystem.\n\nDo you have any further questions about updating to a new version of Verus testnet (VRSCTEST) or the disclaimer?",
