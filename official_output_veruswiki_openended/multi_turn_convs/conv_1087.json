    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how to use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus to send and convert funds. Could you explain some ways to use it and how to specify the parameters for each type of transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus is indeed a powerful tool for sending and converting funds. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\n**Sending Funds:** \nYou can use the `sendcurrency` API to send funds from one address to another. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from `bob@` to `alice@`, you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nYou can also send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients by using the `*Z` wildcard and specifying the recipients' friendly-name z-addresses.\n\n**Converting Funds:** \nThe `sendcurrency` API also allows you to convert funds from one currency to another. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to VRSC-BTC, you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert funds through a fractional currency, such as VRSC-BTC, to another reserve currency, like BTC.\n\n**Preconverting Funds:** \nIf you want to convert funds to a new currency before it is active, you can use the `preconvert` parameter. For example, to preconvert 10 VRSCTEST to a new currency called NEWCOIN, you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\n**Cross-Chain Transactions:** \nThe `sendcurrency` API also allows you to send and convert funds cross-chain, between different blockchains. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from the VRSCTEST chain to the PBaaSChain, you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv\",\"amount\":10, \"exportto\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert funds cross-chain, by specifying the `convertto` and `via` parameters.\n\nOverall, the `sendcurrency` API provides a flexible and powerful way to manage your funds in Verus, allowing you to send, convert, and preconvert funds, as well as perform cross-chain transactions.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using the `sendcurrency` API, or any of these specific use cases?",
