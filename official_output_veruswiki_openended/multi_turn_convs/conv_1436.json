    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to stake my Verus coins, but I'm not sure how to shield them using the command line interface (CLI). Can you walk me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nShielding your Verus coins is a necessary step to use them for staking, and it's part of the Zcash protocol. I'd be happy to guide you through the process using the Verus CLI commands.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\nBefore we begin, just a few important notes to keep in mind:\n\n* When using the Verus CLI, make sure to replace `<userinput>` with your specific user data, without including the `<` and `>` symbols.\n* On Windows, enter the commands without surrounding quotation marks.\n* On Linux and MacOS, precede the commands with `./` (e.g., `./verus listtransactions`).\n* On Windows, substitute the shown `'-character with the \"-character, and the shown \"-character with the \\\"-characters.\n\nNow, let's go through the step-by-step procedure:\n\n**Step 1: Create a new shielded z-address (zaddr)**\nRun the command `verus z_getnewaddress` to generate a new zaddr. You can either use an existing zaddr or create a new one.\n\n**Step 2: Shield your coinbase**\nUse the command `verus z_shieldcoinbase` to shield your coins. You can either shield a specific coinbase or use `\"*\"` (with quotes) to shield all coinbase in your wallet.\n\n**Example Command:**\nTo shield all coinbase in your wallet, use the following command:\n```\nverus z_shieldcoinbase \"*\" <YOUR zs-ADDRESS>\n```\nReplace `<YOUR zs-ADDRESS>` with the zaddr you generated in step 1.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to shield your Verus coins and use them for staking. Do you have any questions about this process or need further clarification?",

            "# Shielding Verus Coin via the CLI.Attention: Read it completely before use.Note: Shielding is no longer required for coinbase rewards after block 800200. Earlier timelocked coins will still need to be shielded in order to use them.### Important General Information`verus command \"<userinput>\"` needs to be entered literally, with `<userinput>` replaced by your specific userdata. So if the text directs you to use for example `\"<Public Address>\"`, you replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the address,\nso it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`.#### General remarks on CLI wallet:On Windows command line enter the commands as shown without the surrounding quotation marks\nIn Linux shell preceed the commands without surrounding quotation marks with `./`\nIn MacOS shell preceed the commands without surrounding quotation marks with `./`\nExample: the windows version `verus listtransactions` transforms in Linux or MacOS to `./verus listtransactions`.#### General remarks on Windows command line formatting:The CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS.\nFor windows substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character.\nFor windows substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters.## Procedure:You must first \"shield coins\" (send from a transparent R-addr to a shielded zaddr) to be able to use them in staking, when they first unlock.\nThis is part of the Zcash protocol itself. The commands below assume you are in the Verus source code directory`verus z_shieldcoinbase`You can either use an existing zaddr or use a new zaddr. To make a new zaddr:`verus z_getnewaddress`Use the address the above command outputs in the `z_shieldcoinbase` commandTo shield all coinbase in your wallet, you can use `\"*\"` (quotes are important) and zaddr that is getting the funds:`verus z_shieldcoinbase \"*\" <YOUR zs-ADDRESS>`",
