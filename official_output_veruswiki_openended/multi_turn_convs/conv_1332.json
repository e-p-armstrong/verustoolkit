    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm really interested in learning more about Verus IDs. Can you tell me about the benefits and features of Verus IDs, and how they provide a secure and decentralized way to manage identities and funds on the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs are a fantastic way to manage your identities and funds on the Verus network. \n\nVerus IDs are quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network, which provide a secure and decentralized way to manage identities and funds. Here are some of the benefits and features of Verus IDs:\n\n**Secure Fund Management:** Verus IDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If the controlling addresses or properties are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys.\n\n**Quantum Resistance:** Although Verus IDs do not currently include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, they are themselves resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms. This means that Verus IDs are secure against potential quantum attacks, and a quantum secure signature scheme will be integrated in the future, allowing for retroactive quantum resistance.\n\n**Decentralized Protocol:** Verus IDs are part of a fully decentralized protocol, which means that anyone can create one and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without permission. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\n\n**Revocable:** Each Verus ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and has the permission to revoke the identity. This creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds.\n\n**Publishing ID->Destination Address Mappings:** Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\nIn summary, Verus IDs provide a secure, decentralized, and quantum-resistant way to manage identities and funds on the Verus network, with features such as revocability, self-sovereign control, and the ability to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains.\n\nDo you have any more questions about Verus IDs or how they work?",

            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerus IDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.",
