    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm playing around with the Verus testnet and I'm trying to figure out how to use the `sendcurrency` API. Can you show me some examples of how to use it to send and convert funds?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert funds on the Verus testnet. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\n**Sending Funds:**\nTo send funds from one address to another, you can use the `sendcurrency` API with the sender's address, the recipient's address, the currency, and the amount. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from `bob@` to `alice@`, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nYou can also send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients by using the `*Z` wildcard and specifying the recipient addresses and amounts.\n\n**Converting Funds:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API also allows you to convert funds from one currency to another. For example, you can convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC, using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC, through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC, by specifying the `via` parameter.\n\n**Pre-converting Funds:**\nAdditionally, you can pre-convert funds to prepare for a future conversion. This allows you to park your conversion until the token launches, and then you will either find the converted amount in your wallet or have your original amount returned.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many ways you can use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds on the Verus testnet. It's important to note that all testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using the `sendcurrency` API or any of these examples?",
