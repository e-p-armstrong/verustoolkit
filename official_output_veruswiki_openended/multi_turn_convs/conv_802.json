    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in using Verus for its multi-currency features, but I want to make sure I'm aware of any important limitations and considerations. Can you walk me through some of the key things I should know?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using Verus, especially with its multi-currency features, there are some important limitations and considerations to be aware of.\n\nLet's start with the first limitation. **i-Addresses as ID Names**: One key limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because Verus interprets an i-address as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. While the protocol does not prevent creating an ID with an i-address as its name, it will cause problems in many cases and is not supported for creating currencies. To avoid user confusion, the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations will also be expanded.\n\nAnother limitation to be aware of is **Conflicting Currency Names (GUI only)**. In the Verus Desktop, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is currently a known issue and will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\nIt's also essential to note that **Verus is experimental and unfinished software**, and users should be aware that they use it at their own risk. No warranty is provided for any kind of damage. However, the software is licensed under permissive terms, allowing users to deal with the software without restriction, including using, copying, modifying, merging, publishing, distributing, sublicensing, and selling copies of the software.\n\nDo you have any questions about these limitations, or any other concerns about using Verus for multi-currency features?",

            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!
