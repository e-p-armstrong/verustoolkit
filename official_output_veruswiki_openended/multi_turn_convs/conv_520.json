    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to figure out how to sign and broadcast a transaction from a multi-signature ID on the Verus network. Can you walk me through the steps? And while we're at it, could you tell me a bit more about the Verus multicurrency, multichain, DeFi enabled testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nTo sign and broadcast a transaction from a multi-signature ID on the Verus network, you'll need to follow a few steps:\n\n**Step 1: Create a Transaction**\nFirst, use the `sendcurrency` command to create a transaction from the multi-signature ID:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n```\nThis will return an operation ID.\n\n**Step 2: Get the Raw Transaction Data**\nUse the `z_getoperationstatus` command to get the raw hex transaction data:\n```\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\n**Step 3: Sign the Transaction**\nTake the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign the transaction using:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\n**Step 4: Broadcast the Signed Transaction**\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```\nNow, let's talk about the Verus multicurrency, multichain, DeFi enabled testnet. This testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that allows for an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. With Verus, you can create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming knowledge.\n\nSome key features of the Verus testnet include:\n\n* Easy GUI for basic operations or command-line interface for more advanced functions\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Ability to convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way\n* Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Accessibility from Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets\n\nOverall, the Verus testnet offers a wide range of features and possibilities for creating decentralized applications, identities, currencies, and more.\n\nDo you have any more questions about signing and broadcasting transactions, or would you like to know more about the Verus testnet and its features?",
