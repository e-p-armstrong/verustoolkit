    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard about Verus Vault, but I'm not entirely sure what it is or how it works. Can you explain what Verus Vault is, and how it provides decentralized fund recovery and protection against crypto loss or theft, including the \"5 dollar wrench attack\"?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is a feature of the VerusID system that provides an additional layer of security and protection for your funds, IDs, and NFTs. It allows you to lock your VerusID, which means that even if someone gains access to your primary keys, they will not be able to spend or access your funds immediately. Instead, they will have to wait for a predetermined unlock time, which can be set to a specific period, such as 24 hours.\n\nDuring this unlock time, the revocation and recovery authority identities can detect the unauthorized unlock attempt and take action to revoke and recover the locked VerusID, effectively circumventing the lock and preventing the unauthorized access. This provides a decentralized solution to the \"5 dollar wrench attack\", a type of attack where an attacker uses physical force or coercion to gain access to a victim's private keys.\n\nVerus Vault not only provides protection against crypto loss or theft but also offers a range of other features, such as time locks for vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This means that you can use Verus Vault to protect and recover your funds, IDs, and NFTs, preserving your blockchain wealth and assets without relying on a traditional bank.\n\nIn addition, Verus Vault allows you to export your ID to a PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) chain, which provides an additional layer of security and flexibility. This can be done using the `sendcurrency` command, as shown in the example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nOverall, Verus Vault provides a robust and decentralized solution for protecting and recovering your blockchain assets, and offers a range of features and benefits that can help you preserve your wealth and assets in the crypto space.\n\nDo you have any more questions about Verus Vault, or how it can help you protect your blockchain assets?",

            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",
