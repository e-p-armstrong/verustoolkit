Can you explain these systems and their impact on the network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Cheat Catcher and Stake Delegation systems are two important features in Verus that aim to improve the security and fairness of the network.\n\nThe Cheat Catcher is a system that enables every miner or staker to detect and prevent stake cheating, which occurs when someone tries to stake two blocks with the same coins on two or more forks. This system compares orphaned stake transactions to successful stakes when they mature, and if it detects a cheat, it allows the miner of the block that is 100 blocks later to mine or stake a spend transaction for that cheat into the block, sending it to a designated sapling address. This creates a statistical losing proposition for cheating, making it unprofitable to stake the same addresses on more than one computer at a time.\n\nOn the other hand, the Stake Delegation system allows users to set a parameter (-pubkey) in the command line wallet, which redirects both mining and staking rewards to the public key of an address. This public key can be obtained from an address using the \"validatekey\" command. This feature enables users to delegate their staking rewards to a different address, providing more flexibility and control over their rewards.\n\nThe implications of these systems are significant for staking and mining rewards. They:\n\n* Make it more difficult and unprofitable for cheaters to stake on multiple forks with the same coins.\n* Allow users to delegate their staking rewards to a different address, providing more flexibility and control over their rewards.\n* Improve the overall security and fairness of the network by preventing cheating and ensuring that rewards are distributed fairly.\n\nOverall, these features demonstrate Verus' commitment to creating a secure and fair platform for staking and mining, and provide users with more control and flexibility over their rewards.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the Cheat Catcher or Stake Delegation systems, or how they impact staking and mining rewards?",

            "### Cheat Catcher\nIn addition to Stake Guard, which supports the nothing at stake solution, this version of Verus includes an early, functional version of the Cheat Catcher, a system that enables every miner or staker to catch stake cheating, when someone stakes two blocks with the same coins on two or more forks. With this version, all known orphaned stake transactions are compared to successful stakes when they mature, and if the orphan was trying to stake the exact same coins but on a different fork and the real fork at the same time, the miner of the block that is 100 blocks later, when that coinbase matures, will mine or stake a spend transaction for that cheat into the block, and send it to a sapling address the miner or staker has set in their wallet. If your wallet catches and spends a cheat transaction the reward for that coinbase will be automatically shielded to your address at the same time as you win the block. The early Cheat Catcher does not broadcast cheating transactions, and it will not catch all possible cheats on the network. It will make it a statistically losing proposition to cheat. This means you should not stake the same addresses on more than one computer at a time. Doing so creates the possibility that you will stake on two forks with the same coins, which puts your earnings at risk. Future cheat catcher implementations will excel at catching cheats on the network.### Stake Delegation\nIn the new Verus network protocol that activates at the same time as Sapling, you can now set the parameter -pubkey in the command line wallet, which will redirect both mining AND staking rewards to the public key of an address, which can be obtained from an address with the \u201cvalidatekey\u201d command.- Timing improvements for more efficient staking\n- Improved support for synchronizing with non-VRSC KMD-family coins\n- Non-mandatory",
