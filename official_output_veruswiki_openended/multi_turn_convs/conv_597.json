    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm having a bit of trouble downloading and verifying the Verus software. I've also been wondering what some of the key features of the Verus Mainnet Protocol are. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen downloading Verus software, you may encounter some common issues. Don't worry, I'm! here to guide you through it.\n\nOne common issue is that antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This warning usually means that the software is mining software, which could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. But don't worry, Verus provides a way to verify the authenticity of the download.\n\nTo verify the download, Verus provides a txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". You can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands to verify the signature of the downloaded archive.\n\nHere are the steps to verify the download:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nThe `verifyfile` command takes three arguments: the signer's identity, the signature, and the path to the file to be verified. The `verifyhash` command takes three arguments: the signer's identity, the signature, and the checksum to be verified. If the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.\n\nNow, about the Verus Mainnet Protocol... The protocol has undergone upgrades to add new capabilities and features. One such upgrade activated support for season 4 Komodo notary node operators and removed the requirement for Coinbase shielding on any coinbases from the past that have not yet been shielded. This upgrade also changed the Verus Proof of Power staking and mining hash, which is now live on the Verus mainnet.\n\nDo you have any more questions about downloading and verifying the software, or about the Verus Mainnet Protocol?",
