    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in learning more about the Verus public testnet. What are the features and benefits of the Verus public testnet, and how does it enable the creation of new blockchains and currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus public testnet is a platform that allows anyone to create new blockchains and currencies with a range of features and benefits. These include:\n\n* **Scale and operational independence**: Each blockchain and currency can operate independently, with its own scalability and performance.\n* **zk-SNARK privacy**: Transactions on the Verus network can be private and secure, using zk-SNARK technology.\n* **Automatic wallet support**: Wallets are automatically supported for each new blockchain and currency, making it easy for users to participate.\n* **100% liquid conversion**: Converting between currencies is easy and efficient, with 100% liquidity at any volume.\n* **Decentralized conversions**: Conversions are fully decentralized, with a standard protocol fee of 0.01% that goes to miners and stakers.\n* **PBaaS Reserve technology**: This technology enables organizations to create their own currencies with their own blockchains, support them in world-class wallets, develop applications, and use them for payments worldwide.\n\nThe Verus Reserve protocol connects each blockchain, allowing for seamless conversions between currencies. This means that users can convert a fractional reserve currency to and from its reserve, according to its exact price, without ever having to leave the blockchain network.\n\nIn terms of creating a new chain, there are some requirements to note:\n\n* **Maximum of 3 eras**: Each chain definition is limited to a maximum of 3 eras.\n* **Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations**: Each chain requires a minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations.\n* **Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization**: A minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST is required per block of notarization.\n* **VRSCTEST required in wallet**: To create a new chain, VRSCTEST are needed in the wallet.\n\nOverall, the Verus public testnet provides a flexible and powerful platform for creating new blockchains and currencies, with a range of features and benefits that make it easy to use and participate in the network.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the Verus public testnet, or how to create a new blockchain or currency?",

            "The Verus public testnet enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. Sending currencies cross-chain or converting between currencies is as easy as sending a cryptocurrency in less advanced systems today, except that the new Verus protocol enables you to include another blockchain as part of your destination and convert a fractional reserve currency to and from its reserve, according to its exact price along the way. All conversions are fully decentralized, require a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network, and calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization of any size to make a currency with its own blockchain, support it in world class wallets, develop its own applications, and use it for payments worldwide that can be converted to the reserve currency without ever having to leave the blockchain network. Each blockchain is independent and connected through the Verus Reserve protocol.\n# Notable Changes\n- Fixed daemon output export error message on VRSCTEST\n- Fixed fees bouncing back from a reserve send to Verus and allow exports to continue if done incorrectly\n- Include currency state in chain definitions for both getchaindefinition and getdefinedchains# Chain definition:- Maximum of 3 eras\n- Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations.\n- Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.\nVRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.",
