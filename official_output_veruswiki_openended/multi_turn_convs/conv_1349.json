    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm new to Verus and I'm trying to download the software. I was wondering, how do I verify the authenticity and integrity of Verus downloads? And also, what are some key changes and fixes in a specific version of Verus, say v0.9.6?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerifying the authenticity and integrity of Verus downloads is a crucial step in ensuring the security and reliability of the software. To do this, Verus provides a mechanism for verifying the signature of the downloaded package.\n\nWhen you download a Verus package, it comes with a `.txt` file that contains the signer's identity, the standard SHA256 file checksum, and the signature. This allows you to verify the authenticity and integrity of the package.\n\nTo verify the package, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted `.txt` file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the `./verus verifyfile` command to verify the file directly, or the `./verus verifyhash` command to verify the file using a checksum.\n\nFor example, to verify a file directly, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"Aa2MIwABQR+fAcDKYxskjVHMQGGDUkWI4NhJdUS/cotKm8S2OucQhk0/p9FDc9OzvHtyU5FMtuhExlyNabb4+ona6dyu21uu\" \"/Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.6-1-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.6-1-x86_64.tar.gz\"\n```\nAnd to verify a file using a checksum, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"Aa2MIwABQR+fAcDKYxskjVHMQGGDUkWI4NhJdUS/cotKm8S2OucQhk0/p9FDc9OzvHtyU5FMtuhExlyNabb4+ona6dyu21uu\" 8cf1ce007e9bd2ff6d1ee68c501e82b5a22ec6eaedab1e5a3c27aa2221bd414a\n```\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.\n\nRegarding v0.9.6, it includes several key changes and fixes. For mainnet, v0.9.6 fixes issues with fee calculation, marketplace offers, and private change addresses. Additionally, it completes all protocol updates and features expected for the mainnet PBaaS upgrade. It is highly recommended to update to v0.9.6, especially for new users and those using the testnet and Ethereum bridge (Goerli).\n\nDo you have any more questions about verifying downloads or specific versions of Verus?",
