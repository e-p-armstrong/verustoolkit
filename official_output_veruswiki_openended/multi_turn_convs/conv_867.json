    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm thinking about using Verus, but I want to know more about the warranty and liability for the software. Also, I've heard that some antivirus software flags Verus as malicious - is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nGreat questions! Let me clarify things for you.\n\nVerus provides its software \"AS IS\", without any warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that Verus does not guarantee that its software will meet your specific needs or work as intended. Additionally, Verus is not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use of its software.\n\nRegarding the antivirus software warnings, it's true that some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because Verus software is related to cryptocurrency mining, which can be used by third parties to exploit users' computers. However, these warnings are false positives, and Verus software is not malicious.\n\nTo understand more about these false positives, you can review resources from reputable cybersecurity companies, such as Malwarebytes and Kaspersky. These resources explain why certain antivirus software may flag legitimate software as potentially unwanted, and how to distinguish between real threats and false alarms.\n\nIn terms of verifying the safety of Verus software, you can also check the VirusTotal detections for different platforms, such as MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows. These links provide information on the detection rates of various antivirus software, which can give you an idea of whether the software is likely to be malicious or not.\n\nDo you have any further questions about Verus's warranty and liability, or the antivirus software warnings?",
