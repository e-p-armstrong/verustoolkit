    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been hearing a lot about VerusIDs and how they're enabling some really cool use cases. Can you tell me more about what VerusIDs can do and how they make things like decentralized tokens, merge-mineable blockchains, and DeFi liquidity pools possible?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are indeed a powerful and flexible identity system that enables a wide range of advanced use cases. Some of the key features and capabilities of VerusIDs include:\n\n**Revocation and Recovery:** VerusIDs can be revoked and recovered, which enables a virtually theft-proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, and identity theft. Users can also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID, which adds an additional layer of security.\n\n**Friendly Name Cryptocurrency Addresses:** VerusIDs can be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. This makes it easier for users to manage their cryptocurrency assets and interact with different blockchains.\n\n**Decentralized Tokens and Blockchains:** With VerusIDs, any user can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain that launched it. These blockchains are 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant, and can be merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n\n**DeFi Liquidity Pools and Fractional Currency Baskets:** Any ID owner can define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocol.\n\nOverall, VerusIDs enable a wide range of advanced use cases, from decentralized tokens and blockchains to DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets. These features make Verus a powerful and flexible platform for building decentralized applications and systems.\n\nDo you have any more questions about VerusIDs or how they enable these advanced use cases?",

This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.\n### Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming\n- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n### Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets\n- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing.
