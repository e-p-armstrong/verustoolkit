    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi! I'm trying to use the Verus API to retrieve a list of currencies that meet specific reserve requirements and have certain markets available. Can you walk me through how to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus API provides a `getcurrencyconverters` function that allows you to retrieve a list of currencies that meet specific reserve requirements and have certain markets available. This function can be useful for finding currencies that have a certain level of liquidity and support for specific markets.\n\nTo use this function, you can run a command in the format `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters <currency1> <currency2>... <currencyN>`, where `<currency1>`, `<currency2>`,..., `<currencyN>` are the currencies for which you want to find markets.\n\nFor example, if you want to find all currencies that have markets for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) with at least 1000 VRSC in reserve and a reserve ratio of at least 10%, you can run the command `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth`. This will return a list of all currencies that meet these criteria.\n\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` function is a powerful tool for exploring the Verus ecosystem and finding currencies that meet specific liquidity and market requirements. By using this function, you can gain a better understanding of the Verus network and make more informed decisions about which currencies to use and invest in.\n\nDid that help? Do you have any questions about using the `getcurrencyconverters` function or interpreting the results?",

BTC ETH:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nWill return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
