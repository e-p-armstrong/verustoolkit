    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nBefore I install Verus software, I want to make sure I understand the disclaimers and potential issues involved. Can you explain those to me, and tell me how I can verify the safety of the downloads?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIt's always important to be aware of the terms and potential issues before installing any software. \n\nThe Verus software is provided \"as is\" without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that the authors and copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software.\n\nYou should also be aware that some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software is related to cryptocurrency mining, which can be installed by a third party to exploit a user's PC. However, these warnings are false positives, and the software is safe to use.\n\nTo verify the safety of the downloads, I recommend checking the VirusTotal detection results for each platform:\n\n* MacOS: [link]\n* Linux-AMD64: [link]\n* Linux-ARM64: [link]\n* Windows: [link]\n\nThese links will show you the detection results from various antivirus engines, which can help you determine the safety of the downloads. Additionally, you can review resources from reputable sources, such as Malwarebytes and Kaspersky, to learn more about false positives and how to stay safe while installing software related to cryptocurrency mining.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the disclaimers or verifying the safety of the downloads?",
