    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about Verus and its capabilities. Can you walk me through the key features and updates of Verus, and how they contribute to its reliability, privacy, and capabilities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus has several key features and updates that contribute to its reliability, privacy, and capabilities.\n\nIn terms of **Reliability and Privacy**, Verus has implemented critical updates to ensure reliable testnet operation and maintain on-chain privacy. One such update is the fix for an issue that prevented parsing of friendly private names to their corresponding z-addresses, ensuring that private addresses are properly handled. Additionally, the wallet has been hardened to prevent crediting of transactions that can be constructed to make a burn look like a spendable output, thereby maintaining the integrity of wallet and address balances.\n\nWhen it comes to **Capabilities**, Verus offers a range of features that enable the creation and management of various blockchain-based assets and systems. These capabilities include:\n\n1. **On-chain Launches:** Verus allows for the on-chain launch of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs, providing a decentralized and trustless way to create and manage these assets.\n\n2. **Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains:** Verus enables the on-chain launch and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without the need for programming, making it possible to create complex blockchain ecosystems.\n\n3. **Self-Sovereign Identities, NFTs, and Profiles:** Verus supports the creation of on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles, providing a decentralized and secure way to manage identities and digital assets.\n\nThese features and updates demonstrate Verus' commitment to reliability, privacy, and innovation in the blockchain space.\n\nDo you have any further questions about Verus' features, privacy, or capabilities?",

Instead, such an address parsed to the main id@. Since this issue could impact on-chain privacy of someone intending to send to or from a private address and using friendly names, we are considering this a critical privacy release.This version also prevents the wallet from crediting transactions that can be constructed to make a burn look like a spendable output, ensuring that unspendable funds are not added to a wallet or address balance. @Alrighttt, who has been focusing on Verus security testing, reported a way that someone might create such an output, and we appreciate that it is before we have ever seen such transactions on the public or test networks. Thanks @Alrighttt for the report and discretion that helps keep them off the network(s) altogether! We recommend that everyone update as soon as possible to version 0.9.9-5 or later.We are working towards the mainnet PBaaS upgrade version 1.0.0, but we cannot put a specific date beyond \ud83d\udd1c on its release.### What\u2019s New for TestNet\nThis release fixes hopefully the last remaining issue that was causing testnet users to experience sync issues on PBaaS chains.There are no other significant changes.### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
