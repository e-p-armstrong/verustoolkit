    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been having some trouble with my wallet, and I've already tried following the procedure for handling a fork. However, I'm still having problems. Is there a way to completely reset my wallet? If so, how do I do it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI understand your concern. If you've already tried handling the fork and are still experiencing issues, a complete wallet reset might be the solution. Don't worry, I'll guide you through the process.\n\nTo completely reset your wallet, you'll need to follow a specific procedure. This involves editing your `VRSC.conf` file, stopping your Verus wallet, making a backup of your `wallet.dat` file, and then restarting your wallet.\n\nLet me break it down step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Edit your `VRSC.conf` file**\nFirst, open your `VRSC.conf` file for editing. The location of this file depends on your operating system: `~/.komodo/VRSC` for Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC` for Mac OS, and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\` for Windows 10. You can also find the location through Verus Desktop by clicking `help` and then `Show Verus data folder (default)`.\n\n**Step 2: Add an export directory to `VRSC.conf`**\nAdd a line to your `VRSC.conf` file containing `exportdir=/home/<username>/` for Mac or Linux, or `exportdir=c:\\Users<username>\\Desktop\\` for Windows. Replace `<username>` with your actual username.\n\n**Step 3: Save and stop your Verus wallet**\nSave the `VRSC.conf` file and stop your Verus wallet. If you're using Verus Desktop or Agama, simply exit the application and wait for it to close completely. If you're using the command line, run `./verus stop` for Linux or `verus stop` for Windows.\n\n**Step 4: Make a backup of your `wallet.dat` file**\nOnce your wallet is closed, make a backup of your `wallet.dat` file by copying it to a safe location. The `wallet.dat` file is located in the same directory as your `VRSC.conf` file.\n\n**Step 5: Restart your wallet**\nRestart your wallet by launching Verus Desktop, Agama, or running `verusd` for the command line.\n\n**Step 6: Export your wallet**\nFinally, export your wallet using the Verus command line. This will produce a different kind of file from the `wallet.dat` file you backed up earlier.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to completely reset your wallet and resolve any issues you're experiencing. Do you have any questions about this process, or would you like further clarification on any of the steps?",

            "# Question: I followed the procedure and am still having problems with my wallet.To completely reset your wallet in the event of a fork, particularly if you've already followed [this procedure](#!faq-allos/faq-allos19_what_should_i_do_if_i_end_up_on_my_own_fork_because_of_a_network_issue_or_having_an_old_version_of_the_wallet.md), follow the steps below.### Verus `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata & `VRSC.conf` standard locations\n * Linux:\t\t`~/.komodo/VRSC`\n * Mac OS: \t`~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`\n * Windows 10: \t`%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`\n * OS independent through Verus Desktop: Click `help`, `Show Verus data folder (default)`### Important General Information`verus command \"<userinput>\"` needs to be entered literally, with `<userinput>` replaced by your specific userdata. So if the text directs you to use for example `\"<Public Address>\"`, you replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the address,\nso it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`.## Procedure\n1. Open your `VRSC.conf` file for editing.\n2. Add a line to `VRSC.conf` containing\n (mac or linux)\n `exportdir=/home/<username>/`\n (or on windows)\n `exportdir=c:\\Users<username>\\Desktop\\`\n3. Save the file and stop verusd for Windows-Desktop or Agama, just exit and wait for it to close completely. For the linux cli run `./verus stop`, or for the windows cli run `verus stop`.\n4. Once your wallet is finished closing make a backup of your `wallet.dat` file somewhere safe. `wallet.dat` is located in the same directory as your configuration file (see above). To make the backup just copy it to another directory, make sure to leave the original there for the time being.\n5. Now restart your wallet by launching Verus Desktop, Agama or running verusd for the CLI.\n6. Now we'll export the wallet (this produces a different kind of file from what we did above).",
