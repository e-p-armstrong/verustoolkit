    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in running Verus on my machine, but I'm not sure what dependencies I need to install. Can you tell me what I need to install on different operating systems, and are there any disclaimers or warnings I should be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo run Verus on different operating systems, you need to install certain dependencies. The dependencies required vary depending on the operating system you are using.\n\n**Linux:**\nOn Linux, the dependency required is `libcurl4-openssl-dev` on Ubuntu 16.04/Xenial, and `libcurl4` on Ubuntu 18.04/Bionic and later. You can install these dependencies using the `apt` package manager.\n\n**MacOS:**\nThe dependencies required to run Verus on MacOS are not explicitly stated, but you can check the VirusTotal detection result for the MacOS version of the software to ensure it is safe to use.\n\n**Windows:**\nSimilarly, the dependencies required to run Verus on Windows are not explicitly stated, but you can check the VirusTotal detection result for the Windows version of the software to ensure it is safe to use.\n\n**Disclaimer and Warning:**\nIt is important to note that Verus is experimental and unfinished software, and you use it at your own risk. The software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. This means that the authors and copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software.\n\nIn other words, you should be aware that the software may not work as expected, and you may encounter problems or errors while using it. Additionally, the software may not be compatible with your system or other software, and you may experience unintended consequences as a result of using it.\n\nIt is also important to note that the copyright notice and permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software. This means that you are allowed to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, as long as you include the necessary notices and comply with the conditions stated in the disclaimer.\n\nDid that help? Do you have any more questions about the dependencies or disclaimers associated with using Verus?",
