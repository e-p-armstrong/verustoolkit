    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in the Verus network and its capabilities. Can you explain how the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network enables the creation of new blockchains and facilitates their interoperation, including crowdfunding currency launches and decentralized bridge confirmation?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is truly a game-changer when it comes to creating new blockchains and enabling their seamless interoperation. Here's how it works:\n\n**Crowdfunding Currency Launches:**\nVerus offers a blockchain-based crowdfunding mechanism for launching new currencies. This mechanism allows creators to set minimum participation levels in their preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimum participation levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants receive an automatic refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and vesting schedules in the pre-allocations.\n\n**Decentralized Bridge Confirmation:**\nVerus uses Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, to provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains. The private blockchains are easy to set up, with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back. This allows organizations to utilize all the features and currencies of the public chain while maintaining control over access.\n\n**Unlimited Scale and Interoperability:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross-notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network enables seamless connectivity between blockchains, with all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool earned on the new blockchain, without rent going back to the Verus blockchain.\n\nIn summary, the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network provides a robust infrastructure for creating new blockchains, crowdfunding currency launches, and decentralized bridge confirmation, enabling unlimited scale and interoperability between blockchains.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the Verus network, or would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access.
