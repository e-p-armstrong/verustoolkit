    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about converting tokens using Verus on the command line. How can I convert VRSCTEST to a new token, and then create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nConverting tokens and creating new ones with conversion options can be a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nTo convert VRSCTEST to a new token, you can use the `sendcurrency` command with Verus on the command line. For example, let's say you want to convert VRSCTEST to a new token called `GOLD`. Here's the format you need to use:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"your_address@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nOnce the new token launches, you can create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST. For example, let's say you want to create a new token called `mycoin` that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. Here's how you can create `mycoin`:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\". Some important notes about this configuration:\n\n1. `proofprotocol` being set to 2 means that it's set to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.\n2. `options` is a configurable integer, in this case set to 33.\n3. `currencies` lists which tokens can be converted to mycoin, in this case VRSCTEST and GOLD.\n4. `\"minpreconversion\": [10000,5.1298]` defines the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin, respectively.\n5. `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of mycoin to 20,000 units.\n\nWith this configuration, you can create a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, allowing for more flexibility and possibilities in your token ecosystem.\n\nDo you have any questions about this process or the specific configurations used?",
