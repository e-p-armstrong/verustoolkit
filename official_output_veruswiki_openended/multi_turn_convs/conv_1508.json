    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm having trouble figuring out how to view and manage unspent transactions using the Verus command-line interface and JSON RPC calls. Can you please guide me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nManaging unspent transactions is a crucial part of working with Verus. Don't worry, I'm here to help.\n\nVerus provides several commands and JSON RPC calls to view and manage unspent transactions. Here's how to use them:\n\n**Listing Unspent Transactions:**\nTo list all unspent transactions, use the `listunspent` command:\n```bash\n> verus listunspent\n```\nThis command will display a list of all unspent transactions.\n\n**Viewing Transaction Details:**\nTo view the details of a specific transaction, use the `gettxout` command, followed by the transaction ID (`txid`) and the output index (in this case, 1):\n```bash\n> verus gettxout \"txid\" 1\n```\nAlternatively, you can use a JSON RPC call to achieve the same result:\n```bash\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"gettxout\", \"params\": [\"txid\", 1] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n**Generating a Proof of Transaction Inclusion:**\nTo generate a proof that a transaction was included in a block, use the `gettxoutproof` command, followed by the transaction ID (`txid`) and optionally, the block hash:\n```bash\n> verus gettxoutproof [\"txid\",...] (blockhash)\n```\nThis command returns a hex-encoded proof that the transaction was included in the specified block. Note that by default, this function only works if there is an unspent output in the UTXO for this transaction. To make it always work, you need to maintain a transaction index using the `-txindex` command-line option or specify the block in which the transaction is included manually (by block hash).\n\n**Getting Unspent Transaction Output Set Statistics:**\nTo get statistics about the unspent transaction output set, use the `gettxoutsetinfo` command:\n```bash\n> verus gettxoutsetinfo\n```\nThis command returns statistics about the unspent transaction output set. Note that this call may take some time to complete.\n\nBy using these commands and JSON RPC calls, you can effectively manage and view unspent transactions in Verus. Do you have any more questions about these commands or managing unspent transactions in general?",
