    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the features and capabilities of the Verus multichain network, and how VerusIDs can be used to lock and unlock identities. Can you explain that in more detail, with some specific examples of the locking and unlocking commands?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multichain network is a decentralized, interoperable network that allows for the creation of an unlimited number of blockchains. These blockchains can be public, available to the world for merge mining and staking, or private, internal blockchains that are easy to set up with bridging of public currencies into an organization's internal network.\n\nOne of the key features of the Verus network is the use of Notary IDs, which provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This enables the creation of private, internal blockchains that can easily bridge public currencies into an organization's internal network, with all the features and currencies of the public chain, but without the access. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate on the Verus network.\n\nVerusIDs play a crucial role in the Verus network, allowing for the creation of identities that can be used for a variety of purposes, including token launches, vesting schedules, and locking and unlocking of identities.\n\nLocking and unlocking of identities is a key feature of VerusIDs. There are two types of locking mechanisms: Time Lock and Time Delay. Time Lock allows an identity to be locked until a specific block height is reached, while Time Delay allows an identity to be locked for a specific number of blocks after the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n\nHere are examples of the commands used to lock and unlock identities:\n\n**Time Lock:**\nTo lock an identity until a specific block height is reached, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n**Time Delay:**\nTo lock an identity for a specific number of blocks after the flags are set back to an unlocked state, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nIt's important to note that revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. Additionally, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\nOverall, the Verus multichain network and VerusIDs provide a powerful and flexible platform for creating decentralized applications and token launches, with advanced features such as locking and unlocking of identities.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the Verus multichain network, VerusIDs, or the locking and unlocking of identities?",

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n#### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\n The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `get",
