    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm new to Verus and I want to make sure I understand the risks and disclaimers associated with using the software. Can you walk me through the disclaimers and warnings, and also tell me how I can verify the safety of the software downloads?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using Verus software, it's crucial to understand the disclaimers and warnings associated with it. The software is provided \"as is,\" without any warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use.\n\nAdditionally, some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program). This is because Verus is a mining software, and some antivirus programs may detect it as a potential threat to your system if installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, this is a false positive, and you can review the resources provided to understand more about these warnings.\n\nNow, to verify the safety of the software downloads, you can check the virus detection results on VirusTotal, a website that analyzes files and URLs for viruses and malware. The links provided for MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows allow you to view the detection results for each platform. By checking these results, you can ensure that the software is safe to download and use.\n\nIt's important to note that the disclaimers and warnings are in place to protect both you and the authors of the Verus software. By understanding these disclaimers and taking the necessary precautions, you can safely use the Verus software for its intended purposes.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the disclaimers, warnings, or verifying the safety of the software downloads?",
