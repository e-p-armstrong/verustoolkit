    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm still trying to learn more about Verus. Can you explain the `importaddress`, `importprivkey`, and `importwallet` commands in Verus, and how they work? I'm not really sure what they do or how to use them.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help clarify that for you.\n\nThe `importaddress`, `importprivkey`, and `importwallet` commands in Verus are used to add addresses, private keys, and wallets to your Verus wallet.\n\n**`importaddress` Command:**\nThe `importaddress` command is used to add a new address to your Verus wallet. It requires an address as a string, and optionally takes a label and a rescan boolean flag. The label is a string that can be used to identify the address, and the rescan flag determines whether the wallet should be rescanned for transactions after adding the address. If rescan is set to true, the command may take several minutes to complete.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `importaddress` command:\n```bash\n> verus importaddress \"myaddress\"\n```\nAnd here's an example of how to use the `importaddress` command with a label and without rescan:\n```bash\n> verus importaddress \"myaddress\" \"testing\" false\n```\n**`importprivkey` Command:**\nThe `importprivkey` command is used to add a private key to your Verus wallet. It requires a private key as a string, and optionally takes a label and a rescan boolean flag. The label is a string that can be used to identify the private key, and the rescan flag determines whether the wallet should be rescanned for transactions after adding the private key. If rescan is set to true, the command may take several minutes to complete.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `importprivkey` command:\n```bash\n> verus importprivkey \"mykey\"\n```\nAnd here's an example of how to use the `importprivkey` command with a label and without rescan:\n```bash\n> verus importprivkey \"mykey\" \"testing\" false\n```\n**`importwallet` Command:**\nThe `importwallet` command is used to import taddr keys from a wallet dump file. It requires a filename as a string, and imports all the addresses and private keys from the file into your Verus wallet.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `importwallet` command:\n```bash\n> verus importwallet \"wallet.dump\"\n```\nIn all cases, these commands can also be used as JSON-RPC calls, allowing you to interact with your Verus wallet programmatically.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these commands or how to use them?",
