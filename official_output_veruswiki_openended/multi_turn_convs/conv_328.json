    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get a better understanding of how to use Verus to retrieve information about past transactions. Can you walk me through how to use the `listsinceblock` and `listtransactions` commands, and what are the different ways to use these commands?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `listsinceblock` and `listtransactions` commands in Verus are essential for retrieving information about past transactions on the blockchain. Here's how to use them:\n\n**`listsinceblock` Command:**\n\nThe `listsinceblock` command is used to retrieve a list of transactions that occurred after a specific block on the blockchain. You can use this command in different ways to customize the output.\n\n**Basic Usage:**\nYou can use the `listsinceblock` command without any arguments to retrieve a list of all transactions that occurred after the last block on the blockchain.\n\n```\n> verus listsinceblock\n```\n\n**Specifying a Block Hash:**\nYou can specify a block hash to retrieve a list of transactions that occurred after that specific block.\n\n```\n> verus listsinceblock \"000000000000000bacf66f7497b7dc45ef753ee9a7d38571037cdb1a57f663ad\" 6\n```\n\nIn this example, the command retrieves a list of transactions that occurred after the block with the specified hash, and returns the 6 most recent transactions.\n\n**Using CURL:**\nYou can also use CURL to send a JSON-RPC request to the Verus daemon to retrieve a list of transactions.\n\n```\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"listsinceblock\", \"params\": [\"000000000000000bacf66f7497b7dc45ef753ee9a7d38571037cdb1a57f663ad\", 6] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n\n**`listtransactions` Command:**\n\nThe `listtransactions` command is used to retrieve a list of transactions for a specific account.\n\n**Basic Usage:**\nYou can use the `listtransactions` command to retrieve a list of transactions for an account, specifying the account name, the number of transactions to return, and an optional 'from' parameter to skip a specified number of transactions.\n\n```\n> verus listtransactions \"myaccount\" 10 0\n```\n\nIn this example, the command retrieves a list of the 10 most recent transactions for the account \"myaccount\", starting from the first transaction.\n\n**Including Watch-Only Transactions:**\nYou can also specify the `includeWatchonly` parameter to include watch-only transactions in the output.\n\n```\n> verus listtransactions \"myaccount\" 10 0 true\n```\n\nIn this example, the command retrieves a list of the 10 most recent transactions for the account \"myaccount\", including watch-only transactions, starting from the first transaction.\n\nNote that the `listtransactions` command can be used to retrieve a list of transactions for a specific account, while the `listsinceblock` command is used to retrieve a list of transactions that occurred after a specific block on the blockchain.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these commands, or would you like to know more about other Verus commands?",
