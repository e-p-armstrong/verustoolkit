    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to get a better understanding of how to retrieve information about the Verus blockchain. How do you use the `getsnapshot` and `coinsupply` commands to get that information, and what kind of data do they return?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides two useful commands, `getsnapshot` and `coinsupply`, to retrieve information about the blockchain. Let me break down how to use each command and what kind of data they return.\n\n**`getsnapshot` Command:**\nThe `getsnapshot` command returns a snapshot of (address, amount) pairs at the current block height. This command requires the address index to be enabled. You can also use an optional argument \"top\" which is a number that specifies the number of addresses to return, i.e., the top N richlist.\n\nWhen you run the `getsnapshot` command, it returns a JSON object that contains the following information:\n\n* `addresses`: an array of objects, each containing an `addr` field with the address and an `amount` field with the amount associated with that address.\n* `total`: the total amount in the snapshot.\n* `average`: the average amount in each address.\n* `utxos`: the total number of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) in the snapshot.\n* `total_addresses`: the total number of addresses in the snapshot.\n* `start_height` and `ending_height`: the block heights at which the snapshot began and finished, respectively.\n* `start_time` and `end_time`: the Unix epoch times at which the snapshot started and finished, respectively.\n\n**`coinsupply` Command:**\nThe `coinsupply` command returns coin supply information at a given block height. If no height is specified, the current block height is used. You can also specify a block height using the \"height\" argument, which is an integer.\n\nBoth of these commands are useful for retrieving information about the blockchain, such as the distribution of coins among addresses, the total amount of coins in circulation, and the coin supply at a given block height.\n\nDo you have any further questions about using these commands or interpreting the data they return?",
