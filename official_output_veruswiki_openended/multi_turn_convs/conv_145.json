    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand the notarization process in Verus, but I'm having trouble with two specific commands. Can you explain the purpose of the `getnotarizationdata` and `getnotarizationproofs` commands in Verus, and how they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you understand those commands.\n\nThe `getnotarizationdata` and `getnotarizationproofs` commands are used to retrieve notarization data and proofs in Verus.\n\nLet's break down each command:\n\n**GetNotarizationData:**\nThe `getnotarizationdata` command is used to retrieve notarization data for a specific currency ID. It takes three arguments: `currencyid`, `getevidence`, and `separatecounterevidence`. The `currencyid` argument is required and specifies the hex-encoded ID or string name of the currency for which to retrieve notarization data. The `getevidence` and `separatecounterevidence` arguments are optional and default to false. If `getevidence` is true, the command returns notarization evidence along with other data. If `separatecounterevidence` is true, counter-evidence is processed and returned with proof roots.\n\nThe result of the `getnotarizationdata` command is a JSON object that includes the notarization protocol version.\n\n**GetNotarizationProofs:**\nThe `getnotarizationproofs` command is used to retrieve proofs for requested challenges. These proofs can be used to invalidate or force a competing chain to provide more proofs in order to confirm a pending cross-chain notarization of an alternate chain that may not agree with the current chain. The command takes a JSON object as an argument, which specifies the challenges for which to retrieve proofs.\n\nIn summary, the `getnotarizationdata` command retrieves notarization data for a specific currency, while the `getnotarizationproofs` command retrieves proofs for requested challenges. Both commands are essential for ensuring the integrity and security of cross-chain notarizations in Verus.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these commands or how they're used in the notarization process?",
