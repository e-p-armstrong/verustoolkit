    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about Verus Vault and its capabilities. Can you tell me more about some of its use cases and how I can work with time locks and delays on identities using the Verus command line?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Vault is indeed a powerful tool that offers a range of use cases beyond just theft resistance and delayed lock opening. One of its key capabilities is providing standard forms of time-locking, which can be used in various ways.\n\n**Time Locking:**\nVerus Vault allows you to time lock and unlock an identity in a single operation. This means you can set an unlock height, which defines the block height at which the identity will be unlocked. This can be useful for providing time-locked funds to team members, children, employees, or for structuring time-locked deal and payment terms.\n\nTo set a time lock on an identity using the Verus command line, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n**Time Delay:**\nIn addition to time locking, Verus Vault also allows you to set a time delay on an identity. This defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n\nTo set a time delay on an identity using the Verus command line, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n* A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\nThese capabilities of Verus Vault open up a range of possibilities for using time locks and delays in various applications, and we can expect to see innovative use cases emerge as the technology is adopted.\n\nDo you have any more questions about Verus Vault or how to work with time locks and delays using the Verus command line?",

            "In addition to use cases related to theft resistance and delayed lock opening, Verus Vault can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms. The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.- **Time Lock:**\n  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- **Time Delay:**\n  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n  ```\n  Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.### Sending and Converting Currency\n**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**",
