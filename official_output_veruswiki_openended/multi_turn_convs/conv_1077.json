Can you explain those to me, and also tell me how I can verify the safety of the software?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using Verus software, it's essential to understand that the software is provided \"as is,\" without any warranties or guarantees. This means that the authors and copyright holders are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liabilities arising from the use of the software.\n\nAdditionally, some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software is capable of mining cryptocurrencies, which could be exploited by third parties to misuse your computer.\n\nTo verify the safety of the software, you can check the Verus software against various antivirus engines on websites like VirusTotal. VirusTotal provides a service that allows you to upload a file and scan it against multiple antivirus engines to detect any potential malware. You can find the VirusTotal scan results for the Verus software on various platforms, including MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows.\n\nIt is also important to note that false positives can occur, and it is essential to review resources from reputable sources, such as Malwarebytes and Kaspersky, to understand the context behind these warnings. By understanding the disclaimers and warnings associated with Verus software, you can use the software safely and responsibly.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the disclaimers and warnings, or would you like more information on how to use VirusTotal to verify the safety of the software?",
