    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been hearing a lot about Verus IDs, but I'm not really sure what they are or how they work. Can you explain what Verus IDs are, and what features do they have that make them secure and flexible for users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus IDs are a type of digital identity that can be used to receive and send funds on the Verus network. These IDs are controlled by single or multi-sig addresses specified within the identity itself, and the controller of the identity has the ability to change these controlling addresses or properties at any time. If changes are made, all future transactions involving UTXOs sent to that identity will follow the updated spend conditions and be subject to the updated keys.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Verus IDs is that they are resistant to quantum attacks using known algorithms. While the current version of Verus does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, the Verus ID system itself is designed to be quantum-ready, and a quantum secure signature scheme is being integrated into the platform. This means that when the quantum secure signature scheme is available, users will be able to change their ID and have all funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\n\nVerus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\nAnother important feature of Verus IDs is that they are part of a fully decentralized protocol, which means that anyone can create one without needing permission. The costs associated with creating an ID are distributed to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Additionally, Verus IDs have several security features, including:\n\n* **Revocability**: Each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and has the permission to revoke the identity, effectively freezing all of its funds in the case of key theft or other security breaches.\n\nOverall, Verus IDs offer a high level of security, flexibility, and control for users, making them a powerful tool for managing digital identities and assets on the Verus network.\n\nDo you have any further questions about Verus IDs or their features?",

            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerus IDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.",
