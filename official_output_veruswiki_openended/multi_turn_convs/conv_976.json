    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in creating my own currency on the Verus platform. How do you define a new currency, and what are the steps involved in launching and using it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nDefining a new currency on the Verus platform is a straightforward process. Let me walk you through the steps involved.\n\nDefining a new currency on the Verus platform involves several steps. First, you need to define the currency using the `definecurrency` command, specifying its name, options, and currencies it can be exchanged with. This command creates a new currency definition, which is then broadcast to the network.\n\nNext, you'll need to specify the currency's parameters, such as its total supply, decimal places, and any additional features or rules that govern its behavior. This information is stored in a JSON object and is used to validate transactions and ensure the currency operates as intended.\n\nOnce the currency is defined, you'll need to create a genesis block, which is the first block in the currency's blockchain. This block is used to initialize the currency and set its initial state.\n\nAfter the genesis block is created, you can start mining or staking to secure the currency's blockchain and validate transactions. As the currency is used and transactions are confirmed, its blockchain will grow, and the currency will become more established.\n\nFinally, to use the new currency, you'll need to create a wallet that supports it. This can be done using the Verus wallet software or by integrating the currency into an existing wallet application.\n\nThat's a high-level overview of the process. Do you have any specific questions about defining a new currency on Verus, or would you like more information on any of these steps?",

The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
