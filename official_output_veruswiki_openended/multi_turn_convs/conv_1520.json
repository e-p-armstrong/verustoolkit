    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still learning about the Verus protocol, and I've come across two commands that I don't fully understand. Can you explain the purposes and formats of the `verifytxoutproof` and `z_gettreestate` commands in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you understand these commands.\n\nThe `verifytxoutproof` and `z_gettreestate` commands are two important tools in the Verus protocol.\n\n**`verifytxoutproof` Command:**\nThe `verifytxoutproof` command is used to verify that a proof points to a transaction in a block. It takes one argument, \"proof\", which is a hex-encoded proof generated by `gettxoutproof`. The command returns the transaction ID (txid) that the proof commits to, or an empty array if the proof is invalid.\n\n**`z_gettreestate` Command:**\nThe `z_gettreestate` command is used to retrieve information about a block's tree state. It takes one argument, \"hash|height\", which can be either the block hash or the block height. If the height is negative, it is relative to the last known valid block, with -1 being the last known valid block. The command returns a JSON object containing information about the block, including its hash, height, and tree state information for both Sprout and Sapling.\n\nThe JSON object returned by `z_gettreestate` includes the following information:\n\n* `hash`: the hex block hash\n* `height`: the block height\n* `sprout` and `sapling`: objects containing tree state information, including `skipHash` (the hash of the most recent block with more information), `commitments` (an object containing `finalRoot` and `finalState` hexadecimal values)\n\nBoth commands are useful for verifying and retrieving information about transactions and blocks in the Verus blockchain.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these commands or how they're used in the Verus protocol?",
