    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI've heard that Verus has a multi-currency technology preview on the testnet. Can you explain how it works, and what are the benefits of its conversion mechanism?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus' multi-currency technology preview on the testnet is a fascinating feature. I'd be happy to dive into the details.\n\nThe preview introduces a new \"sendcurrency\" API that allows for conversions between different currencies. This API is enhanced with new multi-currency parameters, including \"currency\" and \"convertto\", which specify the source and target currencies of the conversion, respectively.\n\nOne of the key benefits of Verus' conversion mechanism is that it eliminates front running, which is a common issue in traditional cryptocurrency exchanges. In Verus, all conversions are processed simultaneously in a single group of transactions, and all conversions are done at the same rate. This means that there is no spread between the conversion to and from a currency, and all users get the same price regardless of the direction of the conversion.\n\nAnother benefit is the low fee structure. Verus charges a fee of 0.025% for conversions, which goes entirely to miners and stakers. Additionally, a planned implied volatility fee will be introduced, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions. This fee will help to offset the risk of impermanent loss for liquidity providers, while also incentivizing them to provide liquidity to less volatile currency baskets.\n\nOverall, Verus' multi-currency technology preview on the testnet offers a robust and fair conversion mechanism that eliminates front running, provides low fees, and incentivizes liquidity provision.\n\nDo you have any more questions about Verus' multi-currency technology or its conversion mechanism?",

            "While Verus daemon v0.7.1-1 has minor improvements for mainnet operation, it offers full support for the new Verus Testnet multi-currency technology preview. On testnet, the new \"sendcurrency\" API, which is already available on Verus mainnet in its simplified form, is enhanced with new multi-currency parameters. The first parameter, \"currency\":\"currencyname\" - where the default on testnet for currency name is \"vrsctest\", specifies the source currency of the send. The next, \"convertto\":\"currencyname\", allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source.# An end to front running\nConversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.",
