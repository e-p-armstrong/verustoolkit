    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to register a new identity on the Verus blockchain. Can you walk me through the process, including how to specify a parent identity and fund the registration transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nRegistering a new identity on the Verus blockchain involves a two-step process. I'll break it down for you.\n\n**Step 1: Register a Name Commitment**\nTo start, you need to register a name commitment using the `registernamecommitment` command. The basic format of this command is:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest registernamecommitment name controladdress referral parent sourceoffunds\n```\nHere, `name` is the name of the identity you want to register, `controladdress` is the address that will control the identity, `referral` is an optional referral address, `parent` is the parent identity, and `sourceoffunds` is the funding source for the registration transaction.\n\n**Step 2: Register the Identity**\nOnce you have registered a name commitment, you can register the identity itself using the `registeridentity` command. The basic format of this command is:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{ID registration with name commitment}' returntx feeoffer sourceoffunds\n```\nHere, `{ID registration with name commitment}` is a JSON object that contains the ID registration information, including the name commitment, parent identity, and other details. `returntx` is a boolean value that specifies whether to return the transaction for signing or submit it directly to the blockchain. `feeoffer` is the fee offer for the transaction, and `sourceoffunds` is the funding source for the transaction.\n\n**Specifying a Parent Identity**\nTo specify a parent identity, you need to include the parent identity's ID in the `registeridentity` command. This is done by including the `parent` field in the JSON object, like this:\n```\n{\n  \"namereservation\": {\n    \"version\": 1,\n    \"name\": \"ID\",\n    \"parent\": \"i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt\",\n  ...\n  },\n  \"identity\": {\n    \"primaryaddresses\": [\"RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr\"],\n    \"minimumsignatures\": 1,\n    \"name\": \"ID\",\n    \"parent\": \"vrsc-btc@\"\n  }\n}\n```\n**Funding the Registration Transaction**\nTo fund the registration transaction, you need to specify a funding source in the `registeridentity` command. This can be a transparent address, a z-address, or an identity. If the parent identity needs to sign the registration transaction, you can set `returntx` to `true` to receive a raw transaction that the parent identity can sign.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to register a new identity on the Verus blockchain, including specifying a parent identity and funding the registration transaction. Do you have any more questions about this process?",

Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`",
