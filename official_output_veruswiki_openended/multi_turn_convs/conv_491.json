    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been looking into Verus and I'm really interested in its capabilities. Can you tell me more about how Verus enables the creation of new blockchains and currencies, and what features are available for launching and maintaining them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides a platform for creating new blockchains and currencies, allowing for seamless connectivity and interoperability between them. Here are some key features and benefits of launching and maintaining new blockchains and currencies on the Verus network:\n\n**Launch Features:**\nWhen launching a new currency or blockchain, Verus offers a range of features to ensure a successful and fair launch. These include:\n\n1. **Minimum Participation**: Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees.\n2. **Automatic Refunds**: If the minimum participation levels are not met, refunds are automatically processed, ensuring that participants are protected.\n3. **Pre-Launch Discounts**: Offer discounts to early participants to incentivize early adoption.\n4. **Price Neutral Pre-Allocations**: Allocate currencies to select IDs before the launch, increasing the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies.\n5. **Vesting Schedules**: Include vesting schedules in pre-allocations to ensure a fair and controlled distribution of currencies.\n6. **Maximum Participation**: Set maximum participation levels in one or more currencies to prevent oversubscription.\n\n**Interoperable Multichain Network:**\nVerus enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. This allows for:\n\n1. **Unlimited Scale**: The Verus network can support an unlimited number of blockchains, enabling unlimited scale and growth.\n2. **Decentralized Bridge Confirmation**: Notary IDs provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be merge-mined and staked.\n3. **Private and Public Blockchains**: Create private, internal blockchains that are easy to set up, with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back.\n4. **Seamless Connectivity**: Enjoy seamless connectivity between blockchains, allowing for easy transfer of assets and information.\n\nOverall, Verus provides a robust and flexible platform for creating and launching new blockchains and currencies, with features designed to ensure a successful and fair launch, as well as unlimited scale and growth potential.\n\nDo you have any more questions about Verus's capabilities or how to create and launch new blockchains and currencies on the platform?",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.
