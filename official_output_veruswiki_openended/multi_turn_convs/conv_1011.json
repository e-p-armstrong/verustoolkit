    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how to create a new blockchain in Verus. Can you explain what a sample chain definition is and how it works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA chain definition in Verus is a set of parameters that define the properties of a new blockchain. I can provide a sample chain definition and break it down for you.\n\nHere's a sample chain definition:\n```\n./verusd -chain=VRSCTEST definechain '{\"name\":\"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\",\"premine\":50000000000000,\"initialcontribution\":5000000000000,\"conversion\":100000000,\"minpreconvert\":45000000000000,\"maxpreconvert\":100000000000000,\"launchfee\":0,\"billingperiod\":14400,\"notarizationreward\":100000000000,\"eras\":[{\"reward\":5000000000,\"decay\":0,\"halving\":0,\"eraend\":0,\"eraoptions\":1}],\"nodes\":[{\"networkaddress\":\"ipaddress:port\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\"},{\"networkaddress\":\"2ndipaddress:port\",\"paymentaddress\":\"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\"}]}'\n```\nLet me explain what each part of this chain definition does:\n\n* **Name**: The name of the new chain, in this case \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\".\n* **Payment Address**: The address where the premine and other funds will be sent.\n* **Premine**: The initial amount of funds allocated to the payment address.\n* **Initial Contribution**: The minimum amount of funds required to launch the chain.\n* **Conversion**: The conversion rate between the initial contribution currency and the native chain currency.\n* **Min/Max Preconvert**: The minimum and maximum amounts of funds that can be converted at launch.\n* **Launch Fee**: The fee required to launch the chain (set to 0 in this example).\n* **Billing Period**: The period of time between billing cycles (set to 14400, or 4 hours, in this example).\n* **Notarization Reward**: The reward given to notaries for their services.\n* **Eras**: An array of era definitions, each with its own reward, decay, halving, and era end parameters.\n* **Nodes**: An array of node definitions, each with its own network address and payment address.\n\nThis chain definition also has some rules and constraints:\n\n* A maximum of 3 eras are allowed.\n* A minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations are required.\n* A minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization is required.\n* VRSCTEST are needed in the wallet to make a chain.\n\nIn summary, this chain definition emits a premine to the indicated address and converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price. All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.\n\nDo you have any questions about this sample chain definition or how to create a new blockchain in Verus?",
