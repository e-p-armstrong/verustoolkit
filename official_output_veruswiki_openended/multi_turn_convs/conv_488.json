    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to use the Verus `sendcurrency` command to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token, and what happens when the token launches. Additionally, I'd love to know how to create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUsing the Verus `sendcurrency` command to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token is a great way to prepare for a token launch. Here's how you can do it:\n\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` command to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches. This is done by specifying the address, conversion details, and amount of VRSCTEST you want to convert. The format for this command is:\n\n```\nST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"your_address@\",\"convertto\":\"new_token\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command effectively parks your conversion until the new token launches. When the token launches, you will either find the converted amount of the new token in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nFor example, if you parked a conversion of 100 VRSCTEST to GOLD, you would either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you would have your 100 VRSCTEST back.\n\nNow, if you want to create a new token, let's call it `mycoin`, that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST, you can use the `definecurrency` command. To do this, you would specify the properties of `mycoin`, such as its name, options, proof protocol, currencies it can be converted to, and initial supply.\n\nHere's an example of how you would create `mycoin`:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"VRSCTEST\", \"GOLD\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\n\nIn this example, `mycoin` can be converted to with either VRSCTEST or GOLD, and its proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID, allowing the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using the `sendcurrency` command or creating a new token?",
