    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble with multi-signature IDs and I was wondering if you could help me out. How can I sign transactions from them? And while we're at it, can you tell me about the key features of the Verus testnet, a decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nTo sign transactions from multi-signature IDs, you can follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Create a transaction and get raw transaction data**\nUse the `sendcurrency` command to create a transaction from a multi-signature ID, and get the operation ID returned:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n```\nThen, use the `z_getoperationstatus` command to get the raw hex transaction data:\n```\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\n**Step 2: Sign the transaction with additional wallets**\nTake the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs, and sign the transaction using the `signrawtransaction` command:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\n**Step 3: Broadcast the signed transaction**\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```\nNow, about the Verus testnet...\n\nThe Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized platform that allows users to:\n\n* Create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming\n* Send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way\n* Access the platform from Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets\n* Enjoy an unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n\nThe Verus testnet is a powerful platform that enables users to do many things that are not possible with other cryptocurrency platforms.\n\nDo you have any more questions about signing transactions from multi-signature IDs or the Verus testnet?",
