    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'd like to dive a bit deeper into VerusIDs and the Verus network. What are some key features of VerusIDs, and how does VerusHash, specifically VerusHash 2.1, contribute to the overall performance of the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs have several important features that make them unique and powerful. Two such features are recoverability and privacy.\n\n**Recoverability:** Each VerusID includes a separate recovery authority, which defaults to the ID itself. This recovery authority can recover the identity by redefining its primary state and recovery state, but it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority. This means that even if an ID is revoked, it can still be recovered by its recovery authority.\n\n**Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used for various purposes such as messaging, financial transactions, or voting. Additionally, each ID contains a content map of key-value hashes, which can be used to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations, as well as selectively provable components of a strong identity, all of which can be attested to with a quantum secure signature when available.\n\nNow, about VerusHash and its impact on the Verus network... VerusHash, specifically VerusHash 2.1, is a crucial component of the Verus network. It is an algorithm designed to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs. The goal of VerusHash is to prevent FPGAs from dominating CPUs in terms of performance, while still allowing FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. VerusHash 2.1 is an adjustment to the equalization technology, which is expected to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs. This means that CPUs will have a better chance of competing with FPGAs in terms of performance, making the network more accessible and decentralized. The Verus developers have proactively made the new algorithm available to FPGA manufacturers, ensuring that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake on the network.\n\nDo you have any further questions about VerusIDs, VerusHash, or the Verus network in general?",

            "- **Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.- **Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.# VerusHash 2.1\nVerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.# Disclaimer",
