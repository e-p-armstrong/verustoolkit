    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a new currency on the Verus blockchain, but I'm not sure where to start. Can you walk me through the process? Additionally, I've heard about setting the proof protocol to PROOF_CHAINID, but I don't really understand the implications of that. And finally, I'd like to know how to reset the testnet.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help! \n\nTo define a new currency on the Verus blockchain, you can use the `definecurrency` command. For example, to define a new currency called \"mycoin\", you would use the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\n\nIn this command, we're defining a new currency with the name \"mycoin\", and setting its options to 97. We're also setting the proof protocol to 2, which corresponds to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID will have the ability to mint new coins.\n\nWhen the proof protocol is set to PROOF_CHAINID, the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins using the `sendcurrency` command. For example, to mint 10,000 new \"mycoin\" coins and send them to the address \"mike@\", you would use the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n\nAs for resetting the testnet, you'll need to delete the following directories:\n\n**On Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/VRSCTEST\n~/.verustest\n```\n\nDeleting these directories will allow you to start the testnet from a clean slate.\n\nDo you have any other questions about defining currencies, proof protocols, or resetting the testnet?",
