    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm exploring the multi-currency features in Verus and I want to make sure I'm aware of any limitations. Can you tell me what I should be aware of, and what the software's disclaimer implies about its current state?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen working with multi-currency features in Verus, there are some important limitations to be aware of. \n\nFirst and foremost, it's essential to understand that Verus is still in active development, and its multi-currency features are no exception. While they offer a lot of power and flexibility, they're not yet fully mature and may have some rough edges.\n\nThe software's disclaimer implies that the developers are still refining and testing these features, and that users should be cautious when relying on them for critical or high-stakes applications. This doesn't mean you can't use them, but rather that you should be aware of the potential risks and take steps to mitigate them.\n\nIn particular, you should be aware that the multi-currency features may not be fully compatible with all Verus tools and services, and that some functionality may be limited or unavailable. Additionally, the developers may make changes to these features at any time, which could potentially impact your usage.\n\nOverall, it's essential to exercise caution and follow best practices when working with Verus's multi-currency features. Make sure to stay up-to-date with the latest developments and announcements from the Verus team, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nDo you have any further questions about Verus's multi-currency features or their limitations?",

            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!
