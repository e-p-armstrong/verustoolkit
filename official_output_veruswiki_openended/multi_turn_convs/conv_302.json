    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to understand how Verus enables private, internal blockchains and how identities can be locked and unlocked on the network. I'd also love to know more about conversion queries and their purpose. Could you explain these features in more detail?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus is designed to support private, internal blockchains, which are easy to set up and can be bridged to public currencies, allowing organizations to have their own private network with all the features and currencies of the public chain, but without public access. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate on the Verus network, making it a scalable and flexible solution.\n\nOne of the key features of Verus is the ability to lock and unlock identities on the network. This can be done using time locks and time delays. A time lock allows you to set a specific block height at which an identity will be unlocked, while a time delay sets a delay in blocks before an identity can be unlocked after its flags are set back to an unlocked state. For example, you can use the following commands to set a time lock and time delay for an identity:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\": <Unlock block height>}'\n\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"setunlockdelay\": <Unlock block delay>}'\n```\n\nIt's important to note that revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height, and a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\nAnother important feature of Verus is conversion queries, which allow you to retrieve information about currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. This can be done using the `getcurrencyconverters` API, for example:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\n\nThis command will return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold. This feature enables users to easily find and convert between different currencies on the network.\n\nDo you have any further questions about private blockchains, locking and unlocking identities, or conversion queries?",

            " well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n#### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n The unlockatblock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\": <Unlock block height>}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\n The setunlockdelay parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"setunlockdelay\": <Unlock block delay>}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nWill return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
