    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard that Verus Desktop has some new features that can be used to explore and develop on the Verus testnet. Can you tell me more about these features and how they can be used?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus Desktop has indeed introduced two exciting new features that can help you explore and develop on the Verus testnet.\n\nThe first feature is a 3D cross-chain liquidity network visualizer. This is a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to visualize the Verus testnet in a three-dimensional space. This visualizer displays all currency conversion and fractional network connections, both on-chain and cross-chain, in a 3D environment. You can interact with the visualizer by moving around, zooming in and out, and exploring the network connections in 3D. To access this feature, simply click on \"Visualize Network\" on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop.\n\nThe second feature is new PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) capabilities. All PBaaS capabilities, including those for application development, are now available on the Verus testnet. This means that you can start building and testing your applications on the testnet, utilizing Verus's transformative technologies. The goal of interoperability on this new testnet is to enable seamless connections between different blockchain networks, starting with the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge. With these new capabilities, you can get a head start on using Verus's innovative technologies and explore the possibilities of building on the Verus testnet.\n\nThese features can be used to explore and develop on the Verus testnet in several ways. The Verus testnet provides a sandbox environment for you to experiment, build, and test your applications and ideas. With the new PBaaS capabilities and the 3D cross-chain liquidity network visualizer, you can gain a deeper understanding of the Verus ecosystem and its potential for building innovative applications. By exploring and developing on the testnet, you can get familiar with Verus's unique features and be prepared to deploy your projects on the mainnet when it becomes available.\n\nDo you have any more questions about these features or how to use them to explore and develop on the Verus testnet?",

            "## NEW 3D CROSS-CHAIN LIQUIDITY NETWORK VISUALIZER (GUI FOR TESTNET)\nIn v0.9.2 Verus Desktop, there is a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer, which shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on chain and cross-chain, with the ability to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions. To access the visualizer, click on \u201cVisualize Network\u201d on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop. If you\u2019re interested in seeing the visualizer now, here\u2019s a link directly to the visualizer as part of a recent video members of the community helped make (https://youtu.be/CkgUVjx_g1M?t=43).## NEW PBAAS CAPABILITIES\nAll PBaaS capabilities, including for application development, are available now on the new Verus testnet. Our goal for interoperability on this new testnet is to launch the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge in the next couple days. Now would be a good time for development capable projects hoping to get a head start on using Verus\u2019s transformative technologies to do a deep dive on the Verus testnet. These new capabilities in v0.9.2, as well as all those we are familiar with, available nowhere else, will be on mainnet SOON(\u2122):",
