    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus to send and convert funds, and also how to define a new currency. Can you walk me through the process?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to explain how to use the `sendcurrency` API and define a new currency in Verus.\n\nThe `sendcurrency` API is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert funds between different addresses and currencies. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\n**Sending Funds:**\nYou can use `sendcurrency` to send funds from one address to another. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from an address named \"bob@\" to an address named \"alice@\", you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nYou can also send funds from all wallet funds to multiple recipients by using the \"*\" wildcard instead of a specific address.\n\n**Converting Funds:**\nYou can also use `sendcurrency` to convert funds from one currency to another. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency named VRSC-BTC, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert funds to another reserve currency, such as BTC, through a fractional currency like VRSC-BTC.\n\n**Preconverting Funds:**\nAdditionally, you can use `sendcurrency` to preconvert funds to a new currency before it is active. For example, to preconvert 10 VRSCTEST to a new currency named NEWCOIN, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\n**Defining a Currency:**\nTo define a new currency in Verus, you need to have an ID with the same name as the currency. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. For example, let's say you have an ID named gold@ and you want to create a currency called \"gold\" that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold. You would use the `definecurrency` command to define the currency \"gold\". Similarly, you can define a new token called \"mycoin\" that has some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\n\nDo you have any questions about using the `sendcurrency` API or defining a new currency in Verus? I'm here to help if you need further clarification.",

The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n",
