    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about how the Verus blockchain and its multichain network support the creation and launch of new blockchains. Can you tell me more about the features available for crowdfunding currency launches and interoperability between blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus blockchain and its multichain network provide a robust infrastructure for creating and launching new blockchains, as well as facilitating interoperability between them. Here are some key features that support this:\n\n**Decentralized Blockchain Creation:**\nThe Verus network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. Each blockchain can have its own notary IDs, which provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that are easy to set up and bridge with public currencies.\n\n**Crowdfunding Currency Launches:**\nVerus supports blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds. This means that you can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of your blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. Additionally, launch options include maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and vesting schedules in the pre-allocations.\n\n**Interoperability:**\nThe Verus multichain network enables seamless connectivity between blockchains, allowing for unlimited scale and new use cases. Fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This means that each blockchain can operate independently, with its own fees and rewards, while still benefiting from the interoperability and connectivity provided by the Verus network.\n\n**Ease of Use:**\nSetting up private, internal blockchains is easy, with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back. This allows organizations to leverage the features and currencies of the public chain, while maintaining control and privacy over their internal network.\n\nOverall, the Verus blockchain and its multichain network provide a powerful infrastructure for creating, launching, and interconnecting new blockchains, with a range of features that support decentralized, crowdfunding-based launches and seamless interoperability between chains.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the Verus blockchain, its multichain network, or how they support the creation and launch of new blockchains?",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.
