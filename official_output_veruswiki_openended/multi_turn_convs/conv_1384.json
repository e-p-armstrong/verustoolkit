    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I was exploring the Verus API and I came across `getcurrencyconverters`. Can you explain what it does and how I can use it to retrieve specific currency converters?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API in Verus is a powerful tool that allows you to retrieve a list of currencies that meet specific criteria. These criteria include having at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, a VRSC reserve ratio greater than 10%, and having all listed currencies as reserves.\n\nTo use this API, you can run a command in the format `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters <currency1> <currency2>`, where `<currency1>` and `<currency2>` are the specific currencies you're interested in. For example, if you want to retrieve all currencies that have both BTC and ETH markets with a liquidity above a certain threshold, you would run the command `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth`.\n\nThis API is particularly useful for finding currencies that have a strong reserve backing and are actively traded with other currencies. By specifying the currencies you're interested in, you can narrow down the results to find the most relevant and liquid markets.\n\nDo you have any more questions about using `getcurrencyconverters` or how to apply it to your specific use case?",
