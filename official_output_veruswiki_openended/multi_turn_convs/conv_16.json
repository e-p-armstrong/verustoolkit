    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to figure out how to send and convert funds in Verus. Can you explain how to use the `sendcurrency` API? Maybe some examples would help.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert funds between different addresses, currencies, and even chains. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\n**Sending Funds:**\nYou can use `sendcurrency` to send funds from one address to another. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from an address \"bob@\" to an address \"alice@\", you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nYou can also send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients by using the `*Z` wildcard and specifying the friendly-name z-addresses of the recipients.\n\n**Converting Funds:**\nIn addition to sending funds, `sendcurrency` can also be used to convert funds from one currency to another. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency VRSC-BTC, you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert funds to another reserve currency, such as BTC, through a fractional currency like VRSC-BTC.\n\n**Preconverting Funds:**\nIf you want to convert funds to a new currency that is not yet active, you can use the `preconvert` option. For example, to preconvert 10 VRSCTEST to a new currency NEWCOIN, you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\n**Cross-Chain Transactions:**\n`sendcurrency` can also be used to send and convert funds cross-chain, between different blockchain networks. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from an address on the VRSCTEST chain to an address on the PBaaSChain, you would use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"RXLYm4J6qi7yam9zXtkEkRwbvCrnWKGZuv\",\"amount\":10, \"exportto\":\"Bridge.PBaaSChain\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert funds cross-chain by specifying the `convertto` and `via` options.\n\nIn summary, the `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert funds between different addresses, currencies, and even chains. With its flexible syntax and options, you can customize your transactions to suit your needs.\n\nDo you have any further questions about using `sendcurrency`, or maybe you'd like some more examples?",
