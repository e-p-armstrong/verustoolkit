    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how VerusIDs handle security upgrades, specifically when it comes to quantum secure addresses. Can you explain how that works and what benefits users gain from this design?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are designed with security in mind, especially when it comes to quantum secure addresses. When a user has an identity name/address, all transactions sent to that address are subject to its spend conditions. This means that if a user has a large number of transactions sent to their identity name/address, they can be retroactively secured under the control of that address if an upgrade to a quantum secure address becomes available.\n\nIn other words, if a user has 1000 transactions sent to their identity name/address, and a quantum secure address upgrade becomes available, all 1000 transactions will be retroactively secured, ensuring that they are protected from potential quantum attacks. This is a significant benefit to users, as it means that they do not have to worry about their past transactions being vulnerable to quantum attacks, even if they were made before the upgrade was available.\n\nThis design also highlights the flexibility and forward-thinking nature of the VerusID system. By building in the ability to retroactively secure transactions, VerusIDs provide users with a high level of security and protection, even as the technology continues to evolve and improve.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any further questions about how VerusIDs handle security upgrades or the benefits of this design?",
