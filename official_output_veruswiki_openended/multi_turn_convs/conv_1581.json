    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi there! I'm interested in launching a new token on the Verus network. Can you walk me through the process of initiating a currency launch, and what are the requirements for launching a new token? Additionally, how can I convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched token, and what are the implications of doing so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nLaunching a new token on the Verus network is an exciting venture! I'd be happy to guide you through the process.\n\nTo initiate a currency launch on the Verus network, you need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST and ensure that it has 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specified rate (e.g., 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch. This launch process is part of the mining process, and miners who participate in the launch earn a 0.025% conversion fee.\n\nNow, let's talk about converting VRSCTEST to a newly launched token. Before the block where the new token (e.g., GOLD) launches, you can send a command to park your conversion of VRSCTEST to the new token. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command effectively parks your conversion until the token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount of the new token (e.g., 0.975 GOLD) in your wallet or have your VRSCTEST returned.\n\nIt's worth noting that once a new token is launched, you can create a new token (e.g., mycoin) that can be converted to with either the newly launched token (e.g., GOLD) or VRSCTEST. To create mycoin, you would need to define its properties using a command like `definecurrency`.\n\nOne important thing to keep in mind is that, currently, the only way to create new tokens is through a centralized issuance option. However, this may change in the future as the Verus network continues to evolve.\n\nDo you have any more questions about launching a new token or converting VRSCTEST?",
