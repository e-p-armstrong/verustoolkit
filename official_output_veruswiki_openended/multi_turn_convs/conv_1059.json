    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been playing around with the multi-currency features in Verus, and I was wondering if there are any limitations I should be aware of. Also, what's the deal with the disclaimer for this software? What am I getting myself into?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen working with multi-currency features in Verus, there are a few limitations you should be aware of:\n\n**Limitation 1:** You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. While the protocol does not prevent creating an ID with an i-address as its name, it is not recommended and will cause problems in many cases.\n\n**Limitation 2 (GUI only):** In the current version of the Verus Desktop, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is temporary and will be resolved before the mainnet release.\n\nAs for the disclaimer, it's essential to understand that the Verus software is still experimental and unfinished. You use it at your own risk, and there is no warranty for any kind of damage that may occur. However, the software is open-source, and you are free to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, as long as you include the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nDoes that clarify things for you? Are there any other questions about these limitations or the disclaimer that I can help with?",

            "#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.### DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
