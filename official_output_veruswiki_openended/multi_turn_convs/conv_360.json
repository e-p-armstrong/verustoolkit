    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to create a new currency using the Verus command line, but I'm not sure how to do it. Can you walk me through the process? Additionally, what are the implications of setting the proof protocol to PROOF_CHAINID? And, one more thing, how do I reset a testnet on a Linux system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help you with that.\n\nTo create a new currency using the Verus command line, you can use the `definecurrency` command. Here's an example of how to create a new currency called \"mycoin\":\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency named \"mycoin\" with specific properties. Let's break down what each part of this command does:\n\n* `\"name\":\"mycoin\"` sets the name of the new currency to \"mycoin\".\n* `\"options\":97` sets an integer value for options, which can be used to configure various properties of the currency.\n* `\"proofprotocol\":2` sets the proof protocol to PROOF_CHAINID, which means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.\n* `\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"]` specifies that \"mycoin\" can be converted from \"vrsctest\" and \"gold\" currencies.\n* `\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]` sets the minimum amounts of \"vrsctest\" and \"gold\" required to convert to \"mycoin\", respectively.\n* `\"initialsupply\":[20000]` sets the initial supply of \"mycoin\" to 20,000 units.\n\nBy setting the proof protocol to PROOF_CHAINID, the controller of the chain ID gains the ability to mint new coins. This can be done using the `sendcurrency` command, like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command mints 10,000 new units of \"mycoin\" and sends them to the address \"mike@\".\n\nAs for resetting a testnet on a Linux system, you need to delete the following directories:\n```\n~/.komodo/VRSCTEST\n~/.verustest\n```\nThis will remove all data associated with the testnet, allowing you to start fresh.\n\nDo you have any further questions about creating a new currency or resetting a testnet?",
