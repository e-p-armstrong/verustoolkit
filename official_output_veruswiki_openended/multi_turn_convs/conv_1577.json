    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating a new identity on the Verus blockchain. Can you walk me through the process and explain the benefits of having a Verus ID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCreating a new identity on the Verus blockchain is a straightforward process, and I'd be happy to guide you through it.\n\nTo create a new identity, you'll need to follow two steps. The first step is to commit to a friendly name that you wish to associate with your identity. This name commitment is registered on the blockchain, but it remains secret until you register your identity and reveal your commitment. The second step is to register your identity, which requires paying a fee of 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity, in which case the fee is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST.\n\nNow, about the benefits of having a Verus ID. One of the main advantages is that you can send and receive funds using a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. This makes it easier to send money to others, as you can use a name that is easy to remember instead of a long and complex address.\n\nAdditionally, having a Verus ID allows you to use various CLI commands that take an address, such as `z_sendmany` and `sendtoaddress`. You can also use your Verus ID to create more complex transactions and interactions on the blockchain.\n\nIt's worth noting that the process of creating a Verus ID is designed to prevent \"name front running,\" where a miner could potentially replace your purchase of an ID with their own purchase of the same name. The two-step process ensures that you have a unique and secure identity on the blockchain.\n\nOverall, creating a Verus ID is an important step in using the Verus blockchain, and it provides several benefits and advantages over using traditional blockchain addresses.\n\nDo you have any questions about the process or the benefits of having a Verus ID?",

            "## Making a new identity\nArguably, the hardest part of the new Verus identity technology is just making your first identity, especially without a GUI. Once you have your own identity, a lot becomes easier, not the least of which is the ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. For example, once you have your identity, either of the following commands will work as well as just about any other CLI command that takes an address:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ \u2018[{\u201caddress\u201d:\u201dalice@\u201d, \u201camount\u201d:100}]\u2019\n```\nor\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100\n```\nMaking a Verus ID requires two steps, steps that are designed to prevent potentially selfish miners from replacing your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead. To prevent this name \u201cfront running\u201d, you must first commit to a name that you wish to have in your identity as its friendly name. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you must have, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.Creating a name commitment registers your commitment, but keeps the name completely secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without and 80 VRSC with a referral is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows:",
