    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to wrap my head around the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network. Can you explain some of its key features, and how I can control access to identities using time locks and time delays?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network is a powerful and flexible platform that enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. This allows for a wide range of use cases, from public blockchains that are open to the world to private, internal blockchains that are restricted to a specific organization.\n\nOne of the key features of the Verus network is its ability to support decentralized bridge confirmation using Notary IDs, which are specified at chain definition. This enables seamless bridging of public currencies into an organization's internal private network, and back again, with all the features and currencies of the public chain but without the access.\n\nIn addition to its scalability and interoperability, the Verus network also provides a high degree of control over access to identities. This is achieved through the use of time locks and time delays, which can be set up using the `updateidentity` command.\n\nA time lock is a parameter that defines the unlock height of an identity, which means that the identity will remain locked until a certain block height is reached. This can be useful for ensuring that an identity is only accessible after a certain condition has been met, such as the completion of a token sale.\n\nA time delay, on the other hand, is a parameter that defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. This can be useful for adding an additional layer of security to an identity, by requiring a certain amount of time to pass before the identity can be unlocked again.\n\nIt's also important to note that revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of any time delay or unlock height that may have been set. Additionally, a locked identity cannot revoke itself, which helps to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network, or how to use time locks and time delays to control access to identities?",

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n## Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- **Time Delay:**\n  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n## Conversion Q",
