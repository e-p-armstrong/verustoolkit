    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm trying to figure out how to use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds, and I was also wondering about the steps to define a new currency using the `definecurrency` command. Can you help me out?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API is a powerful tool in Verus that allows you to send and convert funds between different addresses and currencies. I'd be happy to walk you through some examples of how to use it.\n\n**Sending Funds:**\nTo send funds from one address to another, you can use the `sendcurrency` API with the `address` and `amount` parameters. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from `bob@` to `alice@`, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nYou can also send funds from all wallet funds to multiple recipients by using the `*` wildcard and specifying multiple recipient addresses and amounts.\n\n**Converting Funds:**\nIn addition to sending funds, the `sendcurrency` API can also be used to convert funds from one currency to another. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to TESTCOIN, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"TESTCOIN\"}]'\n```\n**Preconverting Funds:**\nIf you want to preconvert funds to a new currency before it is active, you can use the `preconvert` parameter. For example, to preconvert 10 VRSCTEST to NEWCOIN before it is active, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\nNow, about defining a new currency...\n\n**Defining a Currency:**\nTo define a new currency, you need to create an ID with the same name as the currency, and then use the `definecurrency` command to define the currency's properties. For example, to define a currency called \"gold\", you would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a currency called \"gold\" with specific options, conversion rates, and preallocation amounts. Note that the controller of the ID \"gold@\" is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\n\nDo you have any questions about these examples or the process of using `sendcurrency` and `definecurrency`?",

            "The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.\n**Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Converting VRSCTEST to another currency, TESTCOIN:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"TESTCOIN\"}]'\n```\n**Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```## Defining a CurrencyTo create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start.
