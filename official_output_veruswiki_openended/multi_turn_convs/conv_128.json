    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having some trouble downloading and installing Verus software. I've got some questions about common issues that may arise during this process and how to verify the authenticity of the downloads. Can you help?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen downloading and installing Verus software, you may encounter some common issues. For instance, two anti-virus programs, Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which are warnings that the software includes mining capabilities that could potentially be exploited by third parties to use your PC for mining.\n\nTo address these warnings, it's essential to understand that they are false positives, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about these warnings.\n\nMore importantly, to ensure the authenticity and safety of the downloads, Verus provides a way to verify the downloads using digital signatures and checksums. Each download comes with a `txt` file that includes the signer, standard `sha256` file checksum, and signature. These packages are signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\".\n\nTo verify the downloads, follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted `txt` file.\n3. Extract the archive to the desired directory.\n\nYou can use the Verus CLI to verify the files directly or using a checksum. Here are some CLI examples:\n\n**Verifying file directly:**\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AakaFwABQR+eYI49GX0y/z1x0Abr375LlHTD01ADTTBfA5D9uVhGvTtILdO+DwOmnWgWw6twtNQ3RBOs+jVHkVe04grz+NAO /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-3-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-3-x86_64.tar.gz\n```\n**Verifying using a checksum:**\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AakaFwABQR+eYI49GX0y/z1x0Abr375LlHTD01ADTTBfA5D9uVhGvTtILdO+DwOmnWgWw6twtNQ3RBOs+jVHkVe04grz+NAO 2db05535dbc92292e18aab2e2d0a057322fcca42e7ee106ef16e267063201765\n```\nThe result will be `true` if the signature is valid.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that your Verus software downloads are genuine and safe to use. Do you have any further questions about downloading and installing Verus software, or verifying the authenticity of the downloads?",
