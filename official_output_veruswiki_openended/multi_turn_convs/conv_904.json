    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nBefore I install the Verus software, I want to make sure I understand the terms and conditions of using it. Can you explain those to me, and also tell me how I can verify the safety of the software before installing it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen using the Verus software, it is essential to understand the terms and conditions under which it is provided. The software is considered experimental and unfinished, and its use comes with no warranty or guarantee. This means that you, the user, assume all risks associated with using the software, and the developers and copyright holders are not liable for any damages or claims arising from its use.\n\nThe software is provided under an open-source license, which grants you the freedom to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software, as well as permit others to do so. However, this license comes with certain conditions, including the requirement to include the enclosed copyright notice and permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n\nNow, about verifying the safety of the software before installing it. The developers have provided links to VirusTotal, a website that scans files for viruses and malware, for each platform (MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows). By checking the detection results on VirusTotal, you can get an idea of whether the software is likely to be safe to install on your system. However, keep in mind that no software is completely risk-free, and it is always a good idea to exercise caution when installing new software.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the terms and conditions of using the Verus software, or about verifying its safety?",
