    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm getting started with multi-currency in Verus, and I want to make sure I'm aware of any limitations or disclaimers I should know about. Can you walk me through what I need to be aware of?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen working with multi-currency in Verus, there are a few important limitations and disclaimers to keep in mind.\n\nFirst, let's cover the limitations. There are two main ones to be aware of:\n\n**Limitation 1: IDs with i-addresses as names**\nIn both the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command-Line Interface (CLI), you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. To avoid confusion, it's generally advised not to create IDs with i-addresses as names, as this can cause problems in various scenarios.\n\n**Limitation 2: GUI limitation for PBaaS chain names (experimental software only)**\nIn the GUI, if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you cannot use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is specific to the experimental software and will not be a limitation in the mainnet release.\n\nNow, it's essential to note the disclaimer:\n\n**Disclaimer**\nIt's essential to note that the software is experimental and unfinished, and users should use it at their own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage that may occur. The software is provided under a permissive license, which allows users to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software without restriction.

            "#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.### DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
