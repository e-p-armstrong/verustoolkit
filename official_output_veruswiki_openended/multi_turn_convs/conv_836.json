    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand VerusIDs better. Can you explain what they are and how they differ from other blockchain ID implementations? Also, I've noticed that antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky sometimes flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\". What's going on with that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to clarify!\n\nVerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol that goes beyond just being an ID system. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, there is no corporation involved in the protocol. VerusIDs offer a wide range of opportunities for identity applications.\n\nSome of the key benefits of VerusIDs include:\n\n* They provide a decentralized and self-sovereign way to manage identities.\n* They can be used to receive and send funds, with the ability to control the spending conditions using single or multi-sig addresses.\n* They are quantum-resistant, making them secure against potential quantum attacks.\n* They have revocation and recovery authorities, allowing for flexible management of identities.\n* They contain zero-knowledge private addresses, content maps, and key-value hashes, enabling private yet selectively provable claims and attestations.\n\nAs for the antivirus software warnings, Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program) because it includes mining software. This is not a virus or malware, but rather a warning that the software has the capability to mine cryptocurrencies, which could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. This is a false positive, and you can review the resources provided to learn more about these warnings.\n\nIn summary, VerusIDs are a powerful and secure way to manage identities on the blockchain, and the antivirus software warnings are simply a cautionary measure due to the inclusion of mining software in the Verus protocol.\n\nDo you have any further questions about VerusIDs or the antivirus software warnings?",
