    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have a few questions about the warranty and liability policy for Verus software. Can you please explain it to me? Also, what should I do if my antivirus software flags Verus as a potential threat?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'd be happy to help clarify the warranty and liability policy for Verus software, as well as provide guidance on what to do if your antivirus software flags Verus as a potential threat.\n\nThe Verus software is provided \"as is\" without any warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that the authors and copyright holders of Verus are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use.\n\nRegarding antivirus software flagging Verus as a potential threat, it is possible that some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag Verus as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because Verus is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit a PC. However, these warnings are false positives, and Verus is a legitimate software.\n\nTo learn more about these false positives, you can review the resources provided, such as the Malwarebytes blog post on PUP.Optional.BitcoinMiner and the Kaspersky blog post on \"Not-a-virus\". These resources explain why some antivirus software may flag Verus as a potential threat and how to determine whether the software is legitimate or not.\n\nIt is essential to ensure that you download Verus from a trusted source and follow proper installation procedures to avoid any potential issues. Additionally, if you are unsure about the legitimacy of the software or the warnings from your antivirus software, you can reach out to the Verus community or support team for assistance.\n\nDo you have any further questions about the warranty and liability policy or how to handle false positives from antivirus software?",
