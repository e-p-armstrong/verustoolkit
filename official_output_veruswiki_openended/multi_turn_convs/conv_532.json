    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how Verus supports new blockchain and liquidity pool launches, as well as crowdfunding currency launches. Can you walk me through the features available for these use cases?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus provides a robust framework for launching new blockchains and liquidity pools, as well as crowdfunding currency launches. Here's an overview of the key features:\n\nVerus allows for the simultaneous launch of a new blockchain and a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This bridge converter liquidity pool runs on the new blockchain and generates fees that are earned on the new blockchain, without any rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This enables seamless connectivity between the two blockchains.\n\nFor crowdfunding currency launches, Verus offers a range of features, including:\n\n* **Minimum participation or automatic refunds**: Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of your blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees.\n* **Maximum participation in one or more currencies**: Set maximum participation levels for each currency.\n* **Pre-launch discounts**: Offer discounts to early participants.\n* **Price-neutral pre-allocations**: Allocate a portion of the currency to select IDs, which can increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies.\n* **Price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds**: Set aside a portion of the proceeds for specific purposes.\n* **Vesting schedules**: Include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations using VerusIDs.\n\nFinally, Verus enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. **Notary IDs**, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking. This allows for unlimited scale and new use cases.\n\nDo you have any further questions about these features or how they can be used to support new blockchain and liquidity pool launches, as well as crowdfunding currency launches?",

            "s.\n### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches\n- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)\n- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as w",
