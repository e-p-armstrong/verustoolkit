            "What are some of the command-line options available for customizing the behavior of `verusd`, and what do they do?",
            "When running `verusd`, there are several command-line options that can be used to customize its behavior. Here are some of them:\n\n**Data Export and Import:**\n\n* `-exportdir=<dir>`: specifies the directory to be used when exporting data.\n* `-loadblock=<file>`: imports blocks from an external `blk000??.dat` file on startup.\n\n**Transaction Management:**\n\n* `-maxorphantx=<n>`: sets the maximum number of unconnectable transactions to keep in memory (default: 100).\n* `-mempooltxinputlimit=<n>`: [DEPRECATED] sets the maximum number of transparent inputs in a transaction that the mempool will accept (default: 0 = no limit applied).\n\n**Performance Tuning:**\n\n* `-par=<n>`: sets the number of script verification threads (-4 to 16, 0 = auto, <0 = leave that many cores free, default: 0).\n\n**Process Management:**\n\n* `-pid=<file>`: specifies the pid file (default: `verusd.pid`).\n\n**Storage and Pruning:**\n\n* `-prune=<n>`: reduces storage requirements by pruning (deleting) old blocks. This mode disables wallet support and is incompatible with `-txindex`. **Warning**: Reverting this setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain. (default: 0 = disable pruning blocks, >550 = target size in MiB to use for block files).\n* `-reindex`: rebuilds the block chain index from current `blk000??.dat` files on startup.\n\n**File System Permissions:**\n\n* `-sysperms`: creates new files with system default permissions, instead of umask 077 (only effective with disabled wallet functionality).\n\n**Index Options:**\n\n* `-addressindex`: maintains a full address index, used to query for the balance, txids, and unspent outputs for addresses (default: 1).\n* `-idindex`: maintains a full identity index, enabling queries to select IDs with addresses, revocation or recovery IDs (default: 0). **Note**: Activating requires reindexing, and is not compatible with bootstrap.\n* `-timestampindex`: maintains a timestamp index for block hashes, used to query blocks hashes by a range of timestamps (default: 0). **Note**: Activating requires reindexing, and is not compatible with bootstrap.\n\nThese command-line options provide a range of customization options for `verusd`, allowing users to fine-tune its behavior to suit their specific needs.",
