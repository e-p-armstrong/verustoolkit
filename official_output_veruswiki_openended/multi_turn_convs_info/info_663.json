            "How can I create and launch a custom currency in Verus, and what are the requirements and considerations for doing so?",
            "In Verus, creating a custom currency requires an ID with the same name as the currency. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\n\nTo create a custom currency, you need to define it using the `definecurrency` command. For example, let's say you want to create a currency called \"gold\" that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold. You can define the currency as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency called \"gold\" with specific options, conversion rates, and preallocations.\n\nBefore launching the currency, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST. Then, you need to send the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command to initiate the currency launch. The launch will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and it must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\n\nDuring the launch, miners will earn 0.025% conversion fees for participating in the launch and converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. After the launch, the only way to create new tokens is through a centralized issuance option.\n\nTo convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command converts 100 VRSCTEST to GOLD at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD.\n\nIn summary, creating a custom currency in Verus requires defining the currency, funding the identity, and launching the currency through a mining process. After launch, the currency can be converted and used, and new tokens can be created through centralized issuance.",
            "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sen",
