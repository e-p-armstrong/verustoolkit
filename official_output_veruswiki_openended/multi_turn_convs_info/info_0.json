            "When using Verus Desktop to create PBaaS chains, there are some limitations and disclaimers to be aware of. Currently, if a currency is already supported in Verus Desktop, such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), you will not be able to use those same currency names as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata and will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\nIt's also important to note that the software is experimental and unfinished, and use of it is at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage that may occur.\n\nRegarding the software license, it is provided under an open-source license that allows anyone to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software.
