            "What are the limitations of creating and using multi-currencies in Verus, and what kind of disclaimers should users be aware of when using this feature?",
            "When creating and using multi-currencies in Verus, there are two main limitations to be aware of:\n\n1. **Using i-addresses as currency names:** It is not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This can cause problems when referring to currencies or identities, as an i-address will be interpreted as a reference to the currency or identity with that i-address calculated from its name registration. The protocol does not prevent this, but it is not supported for creating currencies and will lead to confusion.\n2. **Currency name conflicts in the GUI:** In the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same names for a PBaaS chain. This limitation is specific to the GUI and will be resolved in future releases.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\nIt is essential to note that the Verus software is still experimental and unfinished. Users should be aware that they use it at their own risk, and no warranty is provided for any kind of damage that may occur. However, the software is open-source, and users have the right to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software, as long as the copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.",
            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!
