            "What is the purpose of setting the `proofprotocol` to `PROOF_CHAINID` when defining a new currency, and how does it affect the minting of new coins?",
            "When defining a new currency using the `definecurrency` command, one of the options available is setting the `proofprotocol`. In this specific example, the `proofprotocol` is set to `2`, which corresponds to `PROOF_CHAINID`. This setting has a significant impact on the minting of new coins for the defined currency.\n\nBy setting `proofprotocol` to `PROOF_CHAINID`, the controller of the chain ID is granted the authority to mint new coins. This means that the controller has the power to create new coins and add them to the circulating supply of the currency.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's take a closer look at the `sendcurrency` command used to mint new coins:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nIn this command, the `mintnew` option is set to `1`, indicating that new coins should be minted. The `amount` option specifies the number of new coins to be minted, which in this case is 10,000. The controller of the chain ID, identified by `mike@`, is authorized to perform this action due to the `PROOF_CHAINID` setting.\n\nIn summary, setting `proofprotocol` to `PROOF_CHAINID` when defining a new currency enables the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins, allowing for the creation of new coins and the management of the currency's supply.",
            "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
