            "How do I launch a new currency on the Verus network, and what are the requirements for its launch? Additionally, how can I convert VRSCTEST to the new currency, and how can I create a new currency that can be converted to with either the new currency or VRSCTEST?",
            "To launch a new currency on the Verus network, you need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate the currency launch. The launch will start 50 blocks from when the transaction was made, and it must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specified rate (e.g., 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch. This process is part of the mining process, and mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new currency.\n\nTo convert VRSCTEST to the new currency, you can use the `sendcurrency` command before the block where the new token launches. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of the new currency in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.\n\nIf the new currency launches successfully, you can create a new currency that can be converted to with either the new currency or VRSCTEST. To do this, you can use the `definecurrency` command to define the new currency's properties, such as its name, options, proof protocol, currencies, and initial supply. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency named \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either VRSCTEST or GOLD.",
            "urrency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
