            "What are the necessary steps and considerations for updating the ARM CLI wallet on a Linux system, including the standard locations for Verus files and potential differences for ARM installations?",
            "To update the ARM CLI wallet on a Linux system, you'll need to follow a specific procedure. Before you begin, make sure you have the necessary files, including the latest Wallet.dat, Chaindata, and VRSC.conf files.\n\n**Standard Locations:**\nOn an ARM Linux system, the standard location for Verus files is `~/.komodo/VRSC`. However, due to the size of the blockchain, it's common to store these files on an external hard drive, which may have a non-standard file path specified by the user.\n\n**Procedure:**\nTo update the ARM CLI wallet, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Download the latest Wallet**: Download the latest Wallet.dat file from the official Verus website.\n2. **Access the relevant directories**: You may need sudo privileges to access the directories where your Verus files are stored.\n3. **Update your Chaindata and VRSC.conf files**: Make sure your Chaindata and VRSC.conf files are up-to-date and reflect the latest changes to the Verus network.\n4. **Update your Wallet.dat file**: Replace your existing Wallet.dat file with the latest version you downloaded.\n5. **Restart your Verus CLI wallet**: After updating your files, restart your Verus CLI wallet to ensure the changes take effect.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\nWhen updating your ARM CLI wallet, keep in mind the following:\n\n* **ARM installations may have non-standard file paths**: Due to the size of the blockchain, you may have stored your Verus files on an external hard drive with a custom file path.\n* **Raspberry Pi ARM boards have limited capabilities**: While Raspberry Pi ARM boards can be used for staking, they lack some instruction sets and are not suitable for mining. Make sure you have an ARM64 operating system installed if you plan to use your Raspberry Pi for staking.\n\nBy following these steps and considering the specific requirements of your ARM installation, you can successfully update your Verus CLI wallet and ensure you're running the latest version of the software.",
