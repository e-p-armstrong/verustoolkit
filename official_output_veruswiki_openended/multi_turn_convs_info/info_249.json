            "How do I create a currency in Verus and what are the requirements for launching a currency?",
            "To create a currency in Verus, you need to have an ID with the same name as the currency you want to create. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\n\nLet's break down the process of creating a currency using the example of creating a currency called \"gold\". To create the \"gold\" currency, you would need to have an ID named \"gold@\". The controller of this ID can then define the currency using the `definecurrency` command. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\n\nThis command defines the \"gold\" currency with specific properties, such as the conversion rate to VRSCTEST, the minimum amount of VRSCTEST required for conversion, and the pre-allocation of tokens to a specific ID.\n\nBefore the currency can be launched, the identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST. The currency launch will start 50 blocks from when the transaction is made, and it must have 1000 VRSCTEST pre-converted at the specified conversion rate in order to launch.\n\nOnce the currency is launched, the only way to create new tokens is through a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you can use a command like:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"your_address@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command converts VRSCTEST to GOLD at the specified conversion rate.\n\nIn summary, to create a currency in Verus, you need to have an ID with the same name as the currency, define the currency using the `definecurrency` command, fund the currency identity with at least 10 VRSCTEST, and meet the pre-conversion requirements.",
            "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTES",
