            "How do you initiate a currency launch on the Verus network, and what is the process for converting VRSCTEST to the new currency?",
            "To initiate a currency launch on the Verus network, you need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST. Then, you can send a transaction to launch the currency, which will start 50 blocks from when the transaction was made. The currency launch requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at a specific rate (e.g., 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch successfully. This launch process is part of the mining process, and miners who participate in the launch will earn a 0.025% conversion fee.\n\nBefore the block where the new currency (e.g., GOLD) launches, you can send a command to convert your VRSCTEST to the new currency. This is done using the `sendcurrency` command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command effectively parks your conversion until the token launches. When the token launches, you will either receive the converted amount of the new currency (e.g., 0.975 GOLD) in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nAfter the currency launch, you can create a new token (e.g., mycoin) that can be converted to with either the new currency (e.g., GOLD) or VRSCTEST. To create mycoin, you can use the `definecurrency` command, specifying the properties of the new token, such as the currencies it can be converted to, the conversion rates, and the initial supply.",
