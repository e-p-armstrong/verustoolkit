            "How can I park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches, and what happens to my funds after the token launches? Additionally, how can I create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST?",
            "Verus allows you to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches using the `sendcurrency` command. Here's an example of how to do this:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command will effectively park your conversion until the new token, in this case GOLD, launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nIn this example, if the GOLD token launches, you will find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet. If the token doesn't launch, you will have your original 100 VRSCTEST back.\n\nNow, let's assume the GOLD token launches successfully. If you want to create a new token, called mycoin, that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can do so using the `definecurrency` command. Here's an example of how to define mycoin:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\". Some important notes about this configuration:\n\n1. `proofprotocol` being set to 2 means that it's set to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.\n2. `options` is a configurable integer, in this case set to 33.\n3. `currencies` lists which tokens can be converted to mycoin.\n4. `\"minpreconversion\": [10000,5.1298]` defines the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin, respectively.\n5. `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of mycoin to 20,000 units.\n\nWith this configuration, you can convert either GOLD or VRSCTEST to mycoin, and vice versa.",
