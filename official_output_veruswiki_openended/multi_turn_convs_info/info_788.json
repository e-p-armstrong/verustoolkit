            "VerusIDs are a powerful technology that offers several key benefits and features, including:\n\n**Self-Sovereign Identities and Funds Addresses:** VerusIDs are a type of strong identity that allows users to have full control over their funds and identities, while also being revocable and recoverable.\n\n**Staking-Capable Time Locking and Theft Prevention (Verus Vault):** VerusIDs can be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. This feature enables a virtually theft-proof workflow and provides a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the $5 wrench attack, and identity theft.\n\n**Multi-Currency, User-Created, Decentralized Tokens and Merge-Mineable, Interoperable Blockchains:** With VerusIDs, any user can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects can join the worldwide Verus community to improve the daemon, starting with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities.\n\n**Consensus Integrated DeFi Liquidity Pools and Fractional Currency Baskets:** Any ID owner can define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies, allowing for flexible and customizable DeFi liquidity pools.\n\nOverall, VerusIDs offer a range of benefits and features that enable users to have full control over their identities and funds, while also providing a platform for decentralized token creation, staking, and DeFi liquidity pools.",

When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user\u2019s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.\n## Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming\n- Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets\n- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset curre",
