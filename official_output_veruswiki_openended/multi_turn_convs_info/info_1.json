            "Verus v0.9.2 introduces several new features and capabilities that enhance the Verus network, PBaaS, VerusID, and DeFi protocols. These features focus on privacy, visualization, and PBaaS capabilities.\n\n**Enhanced Privacy Features:**\nVerus v0.9.2 provides enhanced privacy features for identity creation, making it more secure and private for users to create and manage their identities on the Verus network.\n\n**3D Cross-Chain Liquidity Network Visualizer:**\nA new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer is available in Verus Desktop, which allows users to visualize currency conversion and fractional network connections both on-chain and cross-chain. This visualizer provides a more intuitive and interactive way to understand the complex relationships between different currencies and networks.\n\n**New PBaaS Capabilities:**\nAll PBaaS capabilities, including those for application development, are now available on the new Verus testnet. This enables developers to build and test their applications on the Verus network, taking advantage of its transformative technologies. The goal is to achieve interoperability between different networks, such as the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge, which will be launched soon.\n\n**Impact on the Verus Ecosystem:**\nThese new features and capabilities in v0.9.2 will be available on the mainnet soon, enhancing the overall Verus ecosystem. They will provide users with more privacy, visibility, and flexibility when interacting with the Verus network, PBaaS, VerusID, and DeFi protocols. Developers will also benefit from the new PBaaS capabilities, which will enable them to build more innovative and powerful applications on the Verus network.",
            "FOR MAINNET (AND TESTNET), v0.9.2 PROVIDES ENHANCED PRIVACY FEATURES FOR IDENTITY CREATION## PROTOCOL FEATURE COMPLETE\nWith v0.9.2, The Verus network, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), VerusID extensions, and Verus DeFi protocols are considered feature complete for the coming mainnet PBaaS upgrade. The core developer focus now is protocol hardening and enabling usage first, followed by user experience upgrades and supporting infrastructure such as identity and login support for lite mode, mobile and web extension wallets as well as merge mining for pool servers.## NEW 3D CROSS-CHAIN LIQUIDITY NETWORK VISUALIZER (GUI FOR TESTNET)\nIn v0.9.2 Verus Desktop, there is a new 3-dimensional cross-chain network visualizer, which shows all currency conversion and fractional network connections both on chain and cross-chain, with the ability to move around and zoom in and out in 3 dimensions. To access the visualizer, click on \u201cVisualize Network\u201d on the Metaverse tab of Verus Desktop. If you\u2019re interested in seeing the visualizer now, here\u2019s a link directly to the visualizer as part of a recent video members of the community helped make (https://youtu.be/CkgUVjx_g1M?t=43).## NEW PBAAS CAPABILITIES\nAll PBaaS capabilities, including for application development, are available now on the new Verus testnet. Our goal for interoperability on this new testnet is to launch the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge in the next couple days. Now would be a good time for development capable projects hoping to get a head start on using Verus\u2019s transformative technologies to do a deep dive on the Verus testnet. These new capabilities in v0.9.2, as well as all those we are familiar with, available nowhere else, will be on mainnet SOON(\u2122):",
