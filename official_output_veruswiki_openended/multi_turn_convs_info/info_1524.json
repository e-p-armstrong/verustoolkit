            "What is Verus Vault, and how does it provide an additional layer of security and protection for VerusID funds, NFTs, and other blockchain assets?",
            "Verus Vault is a security feature that allows users to lock their VerusID, effectively protecting their funds from unauthorized access, even if their private key is compromised. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, it cannot be used to spend funds until it is unlocked. However, the locked funds can still be staked on the Verus network to earn rewards, and funds can still be received.\n\nTo use Verus Vault, you need to have at least one primary identity and one revocation and recovery ID configured. Even when a VerusID is locked, the revocation and recovery authority identities can still revoke and recover the locked ID, bypassing the lock. This means that if someone tries to unlock a locked ID without authorization, the revocation and recovery authorities can step in to prevent the unauthorized access.\n\nVerus Vault provides several benefits, including:\n\n* Decentralized solution to the \"5-dollar wrench attack\" by setting a delay on unlocking locked IDs, giving authorities time to intervene in case of unauthorized access.\n* Protection of funds from theft or loss, even if the private key is compromised.\n* Ability to protect not only funds but also IDs and NFTs.\n* Time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.\n\nOverall, Verus Vault provides a new level of security and protection for blockchain assets, allowing users to safeguard their funds and other assets without relying on centralized institutions.",
            "#### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.",
