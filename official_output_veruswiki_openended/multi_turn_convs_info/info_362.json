            "What are the key features of Verus's Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) and cross-chain currency conversion technology, and what should I do before running a new update on the testnet?",
            "Verus's Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) and cross-chain currency conversion technology allow users to create new blockchains and currencies with various features such as scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between currencies. This technology enables seamless cross-chain currency conversions, allowing users to send currencies across different blockchains as easily as sending a cryptocurrency in other systems. \n\nHere's how it works: when converting between currencies, the Verus protocol allows you to include another blockchain as part of your destination and convert a fractional reserve currency to and from its reserve, according to its exact price along the way. All conversions are fully decentralized, require a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network, and calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.\n\nBefore running a new update on the testnet, it's important to delete the following directories to ensure a clean setup:\n- On Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest`\n- On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST` and `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest`\n- On Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` and `%APPDATA%\\VerusTest`\n\nBy doing so, you'll ensure that the testnet reset is successful and you can start using the new update without any issues.",
