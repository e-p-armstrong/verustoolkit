            "The Verus software is experimental and unfinished, and as such, it is provided \"as is\" without any warranty or guarantee. This means that you use the software at your own risk, and the authors and copyright holders of the software are not liable for any damages or liability that may arise from its use.\n\nThe software is licensed under a permissive license that allows you to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software, as long as you include the enclosed copyright notice and permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n\nWhen downloading and installing the software, you should be aware that some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program). This is because the software is a cryptocurrency miner, and some antivirus software may detect it as a potential threat. However, this is a false positive, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these warnings.\n\nBefore installing the software, you should also review the VirusTotal detection results for your platform (MacOS, Linux-AMD64, or Windows) to ensure that you are aware of any potential risks.\n\nUltimately, it is important to use the Verus software responsibly and at your own risk, and to take necessary precautions to protect your computer and data.",
