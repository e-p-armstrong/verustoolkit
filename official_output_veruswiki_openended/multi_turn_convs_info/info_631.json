            "How do I create a currency on the Verus platform, and what are the requirements for launching a currency?",
            "To create a currency on the Verus platform, you need to have an ID with the same name as the currency you want to create. Only the controller of that ID can create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once. \n\nLet's take an example of creating a currency called \"gold\". To define the currency \"gold\", you would use a command like this:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\n\nThis command defines a currency called \"gold\" with specific properties, such as the conversion rate to VRSCTEST, the minimum amount of VRSCTEST required to convert to GOLD, and the pre-allocation of GOLD to a specific ID, \"mike@\".\n\nBefore launching the currency, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST. Then, you can send the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command to initiate the currency launch. The launch will start 50 blocks from when the transaction was made (by default), and it must have 1000 VRSCTEST pre-converted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\n\nThe mining process plays a critical role in launching a currency. Mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD.\n\nAfter the currency launches, you can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using a command like this:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"your_address@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command would convert 100 VRSCTEST to GOLD at the specified conversion rate.",
            "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTE",
