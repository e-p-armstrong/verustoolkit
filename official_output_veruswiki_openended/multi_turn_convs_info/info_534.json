            "How does the cheat catcher address work in Verus, and what are the benefits of setting it up?",
            "In Verus, a cheat catcher address is a special type of address that helps to prevent cheating on the network. When a full node wallet is set up to mine or stake, it not only performs its usual functions but also actively looks for instances of cheating on the network. Specifically, it searches for situations where the same winning coins are posted on two different forks of the blockchain, signed by the same person. This is a form of cheating, as it allows the cheater to potentially gain an unfair advantage.\n\nIf the mining or staking wallet detects such an instance of cheating, it creates a special transaction that includes cryptographic evidence of the cheating. This transaction is then submitted to the cheat catcher's address, where it is shielded and stored. As a result, the cheat catcher may periodically receive additional shielded coins in their cheat catching address, effectively earning a reward for catching the cheater.\n\nIt's important to note that earning a cheat catching reward does not create new coins, but rather takes them away from the cheater. This mechanism helps to maintain the integrity of the Verus network and discourages cheating behavior. Additionally, earning a cheat catching reward is not dependent on staking or mining power, but rather on who happens to observe the cheating fork and catches the cheater. This means that anyone who has a Sapling cheat catcher address set up can potentially earn these rewards, regardless of their mining or staking power.",
            "- Once your cheat catcher address has been set, a **full node wallet that is mining OR staking, will also be looking for forks where the same winning coins may be posted on two different forks, signed by the same person.** If this is ever discovered, the the mining or staking wallet will create a transaction that has cryptographic evidence of the cheating and submit it for shielding to the cheat catcher\u2019s address. That means that while staking or mining, anyone who has a Sapling cheat catcher address set, may periodically find an additional shielded coinbase or two in their cheat catching address. **Earning cheat catching rewards does not new create coins, but actually takes them from cheaters, so DON\u2019T CHEAT :) !** Earning a cheat catching reward can also occur whether or not you earn a block reward and is available equally across the network to all miners and stakers, more dependent on who happens to observe the cheating fork and catches the cheater than on staking or mining power.## Version 0.4.0c also fixes the following issues reported in prior versions:\n- Wallet balance can get out of sync with blockchain when staking\n- Some non-Latin usernames cause failure to load\n- When used to load KMD in GUI Agama, Komodo stops accruing interest after transfer\n### IF YOUR WALLET IS OUT OF SYNC, YOU CAN RESCAN TO FIX THE PROBLEM.",
