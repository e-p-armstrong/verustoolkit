            "How do I register an identity on the Verus network using the command line, and what are some limitations to be aware of when creating currencies from identities?",
            "To register an identity on the Verus network using the command line, you can use the `registeridentity` command. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{\"txid\": \"67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f\",\"namereservation\": { \"version\": 1, \"name\": \"ID\", \"parent\": \"i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt\", \"salt\": \"b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01\", \"referral\": \"\"},\"identity\":{\"primaryaddresses\":[\"RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr\"],\"minimumsignatures\":1,\"name\":\"ID\",\"parent\":\"vrsc-btc@\"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny\n```\n\nThis command registers an identity on the `vrsctest` chain with the specified properties.\n\nWhen creating currencies from identities, there are some limitations to be aware of:\n\n1. **Using i-addresses as names**: It is not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its name, as it can cause problems when referring to the currency or identity in the future. This is because an i-address is typically generated based on a name registration, and using it as a name can lead to confusion. To avoid this, Verus will expand the set of characters that are not allowed for currency registrations.\n\nIn general, it's important to carefully plan and execute identity registrations and currency creations to avoid potential issues and ensure smooth operation on the Verus network.",

Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.",
