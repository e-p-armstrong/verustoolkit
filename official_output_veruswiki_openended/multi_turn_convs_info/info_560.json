            "What steps can I take to resolve a blockchain mismatch on my Verus node, using the command line interface?",
            "If you suspect that your Verus node has a blockchain mismatch, you can follow these steps to resolve the issue:\n\n**Step 1: Find the Earliest Incorrect Block**\nUse the `getblockhash` command to find the earliest block that doesn't match the blockchain. For example, `./verus getblockhash <suspected blocknumber>` will show you the block hash for the specified block number.\n\n**Step 2: Compare with the Explorer**\nCompare the block hash from your node with the one shown on the Verus explorer. If they don't match, repeat steps 1 and 2 until you find the earliest block that is different.\n\n**Step 3: Invalidate the Incorrect Block**\nUse the `invalidateblock` command to invalidate the earliest incorrect block hash. For example, `./verus invalidateblock <earliest incorrect blockhash>`.\n\n**Step 4: Reconsider the Correct Block**\nUse the `reconsiderblock` command to reconsider the correct block hash that you found on the explorer. For example, `./verus reconsiderblock <correct blockhash>`.\n\n**Step 5: Synchronize with the Correct Chain**\nOnce you've invalidated the incorrect block and reconsidered the correct one, your node will quickly synchronize with the correct chain. If needed, you can restart your daemon to force new connections or manually disconnect bad nodes.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve a blockchain mismatch on your Verus node using the command line interface.",
            "### CLI\n1. Search for the **earliest** block that not matches the blockchain:\n  `./verus getblockhash <suspected blocknumber>` will show you the blockhash for the blocknumber you filled in\n  The response will be similar to this:\n  `5cc7844973fb95ef17f1772ea4aba579f0d8273fb0ee6064cd8e707d1056c646`\n2. Check the blockhash your command gave you against the blockhash the [explorer](https://explorer.verus.io) shows.\n3. If the blockhash from the explorer is different than yours, repeat steps 1 & 2 until you find the earliest block that is different.\n4. Use the **earliest incorrect blockhash** from your system to invalidate that block:\n  `./verus invalidateblock <earliest incorrect blockhash>`\n  The deamon will not give feedback on this command.\n5. Now use the **correct blockhash** that the explorer gave you for the block you just locally invalidated:\n  `./verus reconsiderblock <correct blockhash>`\n  Again the daemon will not give feedback on this command.\n6. Once your daemon connects to a node that is on the correct chain, it will quicly synchronize.\n  If needed you can either restart your daemon to force new connections or manually disconnect bad nodes.\n\n(submitted by @jimboscott, Edited by Oink.vrsc@)\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-11-11.",
