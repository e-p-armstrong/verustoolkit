            "How do I create a currency on the Verus platform, and what are the requirements for doing so?",
            "To create a currency on the Verus platform, you need to have an ID with the same name as the currency you want to create. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once. \n\nLet's break down an example of how to create a currency. Suppose you want to create a currency called \"gold\" that maps to a specific, auditable store of gold. You would first need to have an ID called \"gold@\". Then, you can define the currency \"gold\" using the `definecurrency` command. \n\nHere's an example of how to do this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a currency called \"gold\" with certain properties. \n\nIn this example, \"options\" is an integer that can be set to different values to enable different features for the currency. \"currencies\" specifies the currencies that can be converted to \"gold\". \"conversions\" defines the conversion ratio between \"gold\" and the currencies listed in \"currencies\". \"minpreconversion\" specifies the minimum amount of the currencies listed in \"currencies\" needed to convert to \"gold\". Finally, \"preallocations\" allows you to pre-allocate a certain amount of \"gold\" to a specific ID, in this case \"mike@\".\n\nNote that this is just an example, and the specific properties and values you choose will depend on your use case. Additionally, this is just a test currency, so you would need to send some \"gold\" to yourself to start using it.",
            "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start.
