            "How do I use the Verus command line to get current price and other currency statistics for a specific block or range of blocks, and how do I refund contributions made to a failed PBaaS chain launch?",
            "To retrieve current price and other currency statistics using Verus, you can use the `getcurrencystate` command. Here are the different ways you can use it:\n\n**Getting current price and statistics for the most recent block:**\nTo get the current price and statistics for the most recent block, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate\n```\nThis will return the current price and other currency statistics for the most recent block on the specified chain.\n\n**Getting current price and statistics for a specific block:**\nTo get the current price and statistics for a specific block, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum\n```\nReplace `blocknum` with the number of the block for which you want to retrieve the information.\n\n**Getting current price and statistics for a range of blocks:**\nTo get the current price and statistics for a range of blocks, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```\nReplace `startblocknum` and `endblocknum` with the numbers of the blocks that define the range, and `blockstostep` with the number of blocks to step between each result.\n\n**Refunding contributions made to a failed PBaaS chain launch:**\nIf a PBaaS chain launch fails, you can refund the contributions made to it using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME\n```\nReplace `CHAINNAME` with the name of the failed PBaaS chain.\n\nRemember to always use Verus at your own risk, as it is experimental and unfinished software.",
