            "How do I use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds on the Verus testnet, including sending funds from a single address to a single recipient and sending funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients?",
            "The `sendcurrency` API is a powerful tool for sending and converting funds on the Verus testnet. Here's how to use it:\n\n**Sending Funds from a Single Address to a Single Recipient:**\nTo send funds from a single address to a single recipient, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 units of VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to the address `alice@`.\n\n**Sending Funds from All Private Wallet Funds to Multiple Recipients:**\nTo send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":20}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 units of VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to the address `alice@:private` and 20 units of VRSCTEST to the address `bob@:private`.\n\n**Important Note:**\nRemember that all testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset. This means that any funds sent or converted on the testnet will be lost when the testnet is reset.\n\n**Understanding the `sendcurrency` API:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API is a versatile tool that allows you to send and convert funds on the Verus testnet. The API takes two main arguments: the source address or wildcard (`*Z` for all private wallet funds), and a JSON array of objects specifying the currency, address, and amount to send.\n\nBy using the `sendcurrency` API, you can easily manage your funds on the Verus testnet and experiment with different scenarios. However, always keep in mind that the testnet is for testing purposes only, and any funds sent or converted will be lost when the testnet is reset.",
