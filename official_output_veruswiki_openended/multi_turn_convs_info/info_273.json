            "What are the notable changes in the Verus ID and VerusHash 2.1 Network Upgrade, and what are some key features of Verus IDs?",
            "The Verus ID and VerusHash 2.1 Network Upgrade is a significant update to the Verus network, which includes several notable changes. These changes aim to improve the overall functionality and security of the network.\n\nOne of the key changes is the improvement to the FPGA-equalizing hash algorithm, which enhances the network's security and performance. Additionally, this upgrade introduces Verus IDs, a revolutionary decentralized identity technology that provides a secure, quantum-ready, and fully decentralized self-sovereign digital identity system.\n\nVerus IDs are designed to disrupt traditional centralized identity systems, offering a more secure and private way to manage digital identities. Some key features of Verus IDs include:\n\n* **Decentralized and self-sovereign**: Verus IDs are fully decentralized, meaning that users have complete control over their digital identities. This decentralized nature ensures that users' identities are not controlled by any single entity.\n* **Quantum-ready**: Verus IDs are designed to be resistant to quantum attacks, ensuring that users' identities remain secure even in the face of advanced quantum computing threats.\n* **Private**: Verus IDs include built-in privacy features, allowing users to maintain control over their personal information and identity data.\n* **Secure**: Verus IDs provide a highly secure environment for digital identities, protecting users from identity theft and other security threats.\n\nOverall, the Verus ID and VerusHash 2.1 Network Upgrade is a significant step forward for the Verus network, providing users with a more secure, private, and decentralized way to manage their digital identities.",

It is considered fully ready for testing on both VRSCTEST testnet and VRSC mainnet. While this release is likely to work fine on mainnet through the coming activation, it is not yet an official release that you should expect to support mainnet activation. If you install this version, please make sure to upgrade to an official release before network activation, which will happen at block 800200, expected to be mined or staked on December 15th.\nThis release enables two technology upgrades, one that would be considered big news to most cryptocurrency projects, an improvement to the FPGA-equalizing hash algorithm, and a revolutionary, new decentralized identity technology, Verus IDs, that will disrupt today\u2019s centralized systems with the most secure, quantum ready, fully decentralized, self-sovereign digital identity system in the world.\n## Verus ID\nVerus ID includes built-in privac",
