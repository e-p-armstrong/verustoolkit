            "How do I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus testnet or mainnet, and what are the capabilities of the new Verus testnet?",
            "Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs on Verus involves a few steps. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n**Step 1: Create a transaction and get the raw transaction data**\nUse the `sendcurrency` command to create a transaction from a multi-signature ID, and get the operation ID returned by the command:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n```\nThen, use the `z_getoperationstatus` command to get the raw hex transaction data:\n```\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\n**Step 2: Sign the transaction with additional wallets**\nTake the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs, and use the `signrawtransaction` command to sign the transaction:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\n**Step 3: Broadcast the signed transaction**\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```\nNow, about the new Verus testnet: it's a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that allows for unlimited identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. With Verus, you can create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming. You can send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease, and even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange.\n\nThe new Verus testnet offers a range of capabilities, including:\n\n* Creating new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Sending currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains\n* Converting currencies to others on the network without an exchange\n* Accessing the testnet through the Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets\n\nOverall, the new Verus testnet is a powerful platform that offers a wide range of possibilities for decentralized applications, businesses, governments, and individuals.",
