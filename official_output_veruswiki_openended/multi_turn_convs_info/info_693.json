Here are the steps to join the Verus testnet:\n\n**Step 1: Download a wallet**\nThe first step is to download a VRSC wallet. You can download the CLI wallet and Verus Desktop GUI wallet from the official Verus website for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Make sure to verify that the wallet is the most recent version and update if needed.\n\n**Important considerations for CLI wallet:**\n\n* When using the CLI wallet on Windows, enter the commands without surrounding quotation marks.\n* On Linux and MacOS, precede the commands without surrounding quotation marks with `./`.\n* For example, the Windows version `verus listtransactions` becomes `./verus listtransactions` on Linux and MacOS.\n* On Windows, substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character, and substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters.\n\n**Data location:**\nThe VRSCTEST data location varies depending on your operating system:\n* Linux GUI: `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST`\n* Mac OS: `/Users//Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSCTEST`\n* Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST\\`\n\nBy following these steps and considerations, you can successfully join the Verus testnet and start testing the latest capabilities of the Verus protocol.",
