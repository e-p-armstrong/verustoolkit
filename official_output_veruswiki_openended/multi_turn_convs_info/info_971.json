            "How do I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus network, and what are the key features of the Verus testnet?",
            "To sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus network, you need to follow a series of steps. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n**Step 1: Create a transaction and get raw transaction data**\nUse the `sendcurrency` command to create a transaction from a multi-signature ID. This command will return an operation ID.\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n```\n**Step 2: Get the operation status**\nUse the `z_getoperationstatus` command to get the raw hex transaction data.\n```\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\n**Step 3: Sign the raw transaction data**\nTake the raw hex transaction data and sign it using the `signrawtransaction` command on each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs.\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\n**Step 4: Broadcast the signed transaction**\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the signed transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command.\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```\nNow, let's talk about the key features of the Verus testnet. The Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers a wide range of features, including:\n\n* Unlimited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains\n* Easy GUI for basic operations and command line for more advanced functions\n* Ability to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without programming\n* Ability to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease\n* Ability to convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way\n\nThe Verus testnet is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it marks the beginning of a new age in crypto. With Verus, you can do many things that are not possible with other cryptocurrency platforms.",
