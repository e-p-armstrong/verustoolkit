            "What is the significance of the v1.0.7 release of Verus, and what are the implications for PBaaS and DeFi functions?",
            "The v1.0.7 release of Verus is a significant update that marks the completion of investigations into issues with PBaaS and DeFi functions. This release resolves these issues and re-enables all PBaaS and DeFi functions on the mainnet. With this update, all LP fees from exiting a DeFi basket's primary currency will now be properly burned into those currencies before conversion operations take place.\n\nIn addition, all oracle notarizations that were suppressing DeFi, currency sub-ID registrations, and PBaaS chain launches have been lifted from the network. This means that all PBaaS functions are now live and fully operational.\n\nIt's important to note that while this is not a technically mandatory upgrade, it's highly recommended for mainnet users and mandatory for continued testnet use. This is because the update addresses a known issue affecting zero reward PBaaS chains, which can create problems with cross-chain challenges.\n\nAs a result, it's recommended that users avoid launching PBaaS chains with zero block reward emissions until it's confirmed that they are well supported on the network. However, if users do choose to launch such chains, they should be aware that they may experience issues with cross-chain function for a period of time. Users who need to launch chains with zero emissions can discuss their options with development or support teams to understand how to plan and mitigate any potential issues.\n\nOverall, the v1.0.7 release is an important step forward for Verus, and its impact will be felt across the network as PBaaS and DeFi functions are re-enabled and improved.",
            "# Release Notes## v1.0.7\nAnnouncing v1.0.7 - UPGRADE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR MAINNET, MANDATORY FOR CONTINUED TESTNET USEALL PBAAS AND DEFI FUNCTIONS HAVE NOW RESUMED ON MAINNET. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ARE RUNNING v1.0.6 OR LATER AT THIS TIMETESTNET USERS SHOULD UPGRADE ASAP, AS USUAL. THERE WILL BE A FORKING CHANGE ON TESTNET THAT WILL ACTIVATE TO RE-ENABLE ZERO EMISSION PBAAS CHAIN CHALLENGES TOMORROW, AFTER 19:00 UTCThis release marks the completion and full resolution of the investigations that led to the PBaaS and DeFi pauses. As mentioned, all LP fees from exiting a DeFi basket\u2019s primary currency will now be properly burned into those currencies before conversion operations take place.Shortly before this announcement, all oracle notarizations that were suppressing DeFi, currency sub-ID registrations, and PBaaS chain launches were lifted from the network. That means all PBaaS functions are now live and fully operational!Please note: Though the last mandatory upgrade was v1.0.6, and this is not technically a mandatory upgrade, it does address the known and understood issue only affecting zero reward PBaaS chains that can create issues with cross-chain challenges.Until everyone is known to be on v1.0.7 or later, and we announce that such PBaaS configurations are well supported on the network, we recommend that no one launch a PBaaS chain that has zero block reward emissions. If you choose to do so anyhow, your chain should properly launch, but for about the next month, you may have issues with cross-chain function, unless you understand and plan appropriately. If launching a chain with zero emissions is important to you, and you seriously can\u2019t wait, please discuss with someone in development or support to understand your options. We don\u2019t believe that this is a critical early use case, so we actually don\u2019t expect it to be an issue for anyone.",
