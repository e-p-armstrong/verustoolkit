            "What are the key features and enhancements of Verus protocol version v0.7.1-3, and how do they improve the scalability and functionality of the network?",
            "The Verus protocol version v0.7.1-3 brings several significant enhancements to the network, focusing on increased scale, currency burn functions, and centralized fractional currencies. These features are designed to improve the overall performance and functionality of the network, although they are not yet considered hardened for mainnet.\n\nOne of the primary enhancements is the ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency. This allows the currency controller to perform price-neutral minting through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies. This feature enables more efficient and flexible currency management, providing more control to currency controllers.\n\nAnother important feature is the introduction of the \"burn\" parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API. When \"burn\" is set to 1, a currency sent (which must be a token or fractional currency) is officially removed from that currency's supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned. This feature provides a mechanism for currency controllers to manage their currency's supply and value.\n\nAdditionally, this version of the protocol eliminates front running, ensuring that all conversions are processed at the same rate, with no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. This is achieved through the aggregation of import blocks, which allows all transactions in a block to be simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions, providing a fair and transparent conversion process for all users.\n\nOverall, the enhancements in version v0.7.1-3 demonstrate Verus' commitment to improving the scalability, functionality, and usability of its protocol, providing a more robust and efficient platform for users.",
            "# Enhancements to TestNet Protocols for Increased Scale, Currency Burn Functions, and Centralized Fractional Currencies\nVersion v0.7.1-3 is not yet considered hardened for mainnet, but has increased scale over previous versions in addition to the ability to apply both fractional and centralized attributes to a currency. This allows price neutral minting by the currency controller through automatic reductions of the reserve ratio of all currencies. This version also enables a new parameter to the \"sendcurrency\" API called \"burn\". If \"burn\" is set to 1, a currency sent, which must be a token or fractional currency is officially removed from that currency's supply. In the case of a fractional currency, this will have the effect of increasing the on-chain price for all holders, depending on the amount burned.# An end to front running\nConversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.",
