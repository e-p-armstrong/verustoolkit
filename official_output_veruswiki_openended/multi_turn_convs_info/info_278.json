            "What is the `setidentitytimelock` command and API in Verus, and how can it be used to manage time locks on VerusIDs?",
            "The `setidentitytimelock` command and API is a feature in Verus that allows users to manage time locks on their VerusIDs. A time lock is a mechanism that restricts the use of a VerusID until a certain condition is met, such as a specific block height or a delay period.\n\nThe `setidentitytimelock` command can be used in three ways:\n\n1. **Locking an ID until a specific block height**: By specifying the `unlockatblock` parameter, users can lock their VerusID until a specific block height is reached. For example, `verus setidentitytimelock '{\"unlockatblock\":1796500}' (returntx)` will lock the ID until block 1796500 is reached. If the specified block height is in the past, the ID will not be locked.\n\n2. **Setting a time unlock delay**: By specifying the `setunlockdelay` parameter, users can set a time delay before they can spend funds controlled by the ID after unlocking it. For example, `verus setidentitytimelock '{\"setunlockdelay\":1440}' (returntx)` will set a 1440 block unlock delay, which is equivalent to approximately one day.\n\n3. **Unlocking an ID with a time delay**: By specifying `unlockatblock` with a value of 0, users can unlock an ID that has been locked with a time delay. The unlock time will be set to the block height at which the ID was unlocked plus the originally set unlock delay. For example, `verus setidentitytimelock '{\"unlockatblock\":0}' (returntx)` will unlock the ID and set the unlock time accordingly.\n\nThe `setidentitytimelock` command provides users with a way to manage their VerusIDs and add an extra layer of security by restricting access to their funds until certain conditions are met.",
            "## New Command and API for Verus Vault - setidentitytimelock\nv0.9.0-2 introduced a new command and RPC API, \"setidentitytimelock\". setidentitytimelock may be used to set a time unlock delay, set a lock until a specific block height, or unlock a delayed timelock on a VerusID under your control.You can use setidentitytimelock in one of two ways:\n```\nverus setidentitytimelock '{\"unlockatblock\":1796500}' (returntx)\n```\nor\n```\nverus setidentitytimelock '{\"setunlockdelay\":1440}' (returntx)\n```\nor\n```\nverus setidentitytimelock '{\"unlockatblock\":0}' (returntx)\n```\nThe first example will lock the ID until the block specified. If the block specified is in the past, the ID will not be locked.\nThe second example will set a 1440 block unlock delay, which will be needed to wait before spending funds controlled by the ID after unlocking the ID (about one day unlock time).\nThe third example will unlock an ID that has been locked with an unlock delay, and the unlock time will be set to the block height at which the ID was unlocked + the originally set unlock delay.",
