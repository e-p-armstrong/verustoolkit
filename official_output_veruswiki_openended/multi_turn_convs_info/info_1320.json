            "To create a tokenized ID control, also known as a next-generation NFT, on the Verus platform, you need to define a currency with specific options and properties. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\nFirst, you need to use the `definecurrency` command with the `verus` executable. This command is used to define a new currency on the Verus platform.\n\nThe currency definition should include the following flags: `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN`. These flags indicate that the currency is a tokenized ID control, which is a unique digital asset that represents ownership or control of an ID.\n\nThe `max supply` of the currency should be set to 1 satoshi. This means that there can only be one token of this type in existence.\n\nThe currency definition should also include a `preallocation` section, which specifies the recipient of the token and the amount to be allocated. In this case, the amount should be 0.00000001, which is the minimum amount required to create a token.\n\nFinally, the `maxpreconversion` section should be set to 0, indicating that the token is pre-allocated and not pre-converted from another currency.\n\nHere's an example of the command:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```\nBy following these steps, you can create a tokenized ID control, which is a next-generation NFT, on the Verus platform.",
            "### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):\nThe currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release.
