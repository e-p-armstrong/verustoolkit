            "How does Verus support token launches and interoperable, multichain networks, and what features are available for locking and unlocking IDs?",
            "Verus provides a robust platform for token launches and multichain networks. When it comes to token launches, Verus supports various features such as allocation of proceeds, pre-launch discounts for early participants, and vesting schedules for pre-allocations using VerusIDs.\n\nRegarding multichain networks, Verus allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains within the Verus network. This is achieved through the use of Notary IDs, which provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation. This enables public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that can be easily set up with bridging of public currencies into an organization's internal private network and back.\n\nIn terms of locking and unlocking IDs, Verus provides two features: Time Lock and Time Delay. Time Lock allows an ID to be locked until a specified block height is reached, at which point it becomes unlocked. This can be achieved using the `updateidentity` command, specifying the timelock parameter and the unlock block height.\n\nTime Delay, on the other hand, allows an ID to be delayed from unlocking for a specified number of blocks after the flags are set back to an unlocked state. This can also be achieved using the `updateidentity` command, specifying the timelock parameter and the unlock block delay.\n\nIt's important to note that revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. Additionally, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.",

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n## Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- **Time Delay:**\n  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n## Conversion Q",
