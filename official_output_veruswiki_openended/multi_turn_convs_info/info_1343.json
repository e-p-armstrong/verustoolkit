            "What is the Verus Vault feature, and how does it protect users' funds and identities from potential threats?",
            "The Verus Vault feature is a security mechanism that allows users to timelock their IDs, effectively preventing any spending of funds controlled by that ID while still permitting staking. This means that even if an attacker compromises a user's private keys while the ID is locked, they will not be able to spend any funds without first unlocking the ID and waiting for the specified timelock period to elapse.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Timelocking an ID**: A user can set a timelock on their ID, which will prevent any spending of funds controlled by that ID.\n2. **Unlocking and waiting period**: If the timelock is set for a certain period, say one day, the unlock operation itself will require a waiting period of one day. This means that even if an attacker unlocks the ID, they will have to wait for the specified period before they can spend any funds.\n3. **Revocation and recovery**: If a user notices that their ID has been unlocked by someone else, they can revoke and recover their ID before any funds are lost. This ensures that the attacker cannot spend any funds.\n4. **Additional security measure**: For an extra layer of security, users can modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it. This ensures that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys.\n\nThe Verus Vault feature provides a high level of security and protection for users' funds and identities. Even if an attacker compromises a user's private keys, they will not be able to spend any funds without first unlocking the ID and waiting for the specified timelock period to elapse. This technology is designed to provide a \"theft-resistant\" workflow, giving users greater peace of mind when using the Verus network.",
            "The Verus Vault use case, which was originally described in the conception of the feature, is the ability to timelock an ID, which would prevent any spending of any funds controlled by that ID, while still allowing the ID and all its funds to be used for staking. If the timelock was set for one day when locked, the unlock operation itself will require a waiting period of one day, which can only be circumvented by a revocation followed by recovery operation. In practice, this means that even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds (though they could stake them and delegate rewards to another address, which you could immediately see) unless they unlock the ID first and wait one day. If you notice that your ID has been unlocked by someone other than you, you can revoke and recover before any funds are lost at all. If you wanted to get extremely secure, to the point of covering a case where someone may steal your private keys without you knowing and then lay in wait until you unlock your identity, so they can pounce on your funds before you lock it again, you can actually modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it, which ensures that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys. While we believe this unique Verus technology actually provides for fully theft-proof workflows and protection of all assets on the network under the control of an ID, we will generally refer to the technology as \"theft-resistant\" and disclaim all guarantees of fitness for any particular purpose as part of the \"experimental software\" disclaimer.",
