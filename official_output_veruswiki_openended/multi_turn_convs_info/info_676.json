            "After a testnet reset, it is essential to delete the relevant directories to ensure a smooth transition to the new update. The directories to be deleted vary depending on the operating system used:\n\n* On Linux, delete the `~/.komodo/vrsctest` directory.\n* On MacOS, delete the `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest` directory.\n* On Windows, delete the `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` directory.\n\nIt is crucial to note that Verus software is experimental and unfinished, and users should be aware of the risks involved. The software is provided \"as is,\" without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n\nThe terms and conditions of using Verus software are as follows:\n\n* Permission is granted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software.\n* The copyright notice and permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n* The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use.\n\nIn summary, after a testnet reset, users must delete the relevant directories to ensure a smooth transition, and they must be aware of the terms and conditions of using Verus software, including the risks involved and the lack of warranties.",
