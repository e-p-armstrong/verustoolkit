            "What is the purpose of the Verus PBaaS and DeFi testnet, and how can I participate in finding bugs and earning rewards?",
            "The Verus PBaaS and DeFi testnet is a platform for testing and refining the Verus protocol, specifically focusing on the PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) features. The testnet allows users to experiment with the protocol, identify potential issues, and report bugs or errors.\n\nThe Verus Coin Foundation is incentivizing users to participate in bug hunting by offering rewards, known as bug bounties, for the first individuals to report specific types of bugs or security vulnerabilities. The bounty amounts vary depending on the severity and type of bug:\n\n* For reporting a protocol bug, the reward is at least 500 VRSC.\n* For discovering an exploitable security hole, the reward is a minimum of 1,000 VRSC.\n* For identifying a serious potential security issue, the reward can be up to 10,000 VRSC.\n\nTo participate, users can join the #pbaas-development channel and start testing the protocol. If a bug is found, it should be reported to the Verus Coin Foundation, which will verify the issue and award the bounty.\n\nAdditionally, users can reset their testnet by deleting specific directories and restarting the testnet daemon or relaunching Verus Desktop. This process allows users to start fresh and continue testing the protocol.\n\nBy participating in the testnet and reporting bugs, users can contribute to the development and refinement of the Verus protocol, helping to ensure a stable and secure mainnet release.",
            "## Verus PBaaS and DeFi RC6 - BUG BOUNTIES\nAt this time, we are not aware of any bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross chain protocols on this version of testnet. We do not anticipate any changes to the PBaaS protocol before mainnet release, and we hope you will join us on testnet trying out all of the incredible capabilities and looking for any potential, remaining issues that can possibly be found before mainnet release. While we don\u2019t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people (3 still unclaimed) who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended. If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.If you have reported a bug, since the bounties for the 0.9.5+ versions were announced, you are on the list, and someone from the Foundation will reach out to you in the near future.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the #pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for mainnet release this coming week, and start building your vision today!## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):",
