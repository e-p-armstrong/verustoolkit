            "What does it mean to set the `proofprotocol` to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID) when defining a new currency, and how can the controller of the chain ID mint new coins?",
            "When defining a new currency using the `definecurrency` command, you have the option to set the `proofprotocol` to 2, which corresponds to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID has the authority to mint new coins.\n\nIn the example provided, the currency \"mycoin\" is defined with `proofprotocol` set to 2. This allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins using the `sendcurrency` command.\n\nTo mint new coins, the controller would use a command like this:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command would mint 10,000 new units of \"mycoin\" and send them to the address \"mike@\".\n\nBy setting `proofprotocol` to 2, you are giving the controller of the chain ID the power to create new coins and manage the currency's supply. This can be useful for a variety of use cases, such as managing a token economy or creating a decentralized financial system.",
            "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
