            "What are some limitations and important considerations to be aware of when creating and using multi-currencies in Verus, and what is the disclaimer regarding the software?",
            "When working with multi-currencies in Verus, there are some important limitations and considerations to keep in mind. \n\n**Limitation 1: i-Address as ID Name**\nOne key limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because an i-address will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. To avoid potential user confusion, the naming system will expand the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.\n\n**Limitation 2: GUI Currency Name Conflicts**\nIn the GUI, if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is currently considered errata and will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\n**Disclaimer**\nIt is important to note that the Verus software is experimental and unfinished, and should be used at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage that may occur. The software is provided under an open-source license, which grants permission to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, subject to the conditions that the enclosed copyright notice and this permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.",
            "#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.### DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
