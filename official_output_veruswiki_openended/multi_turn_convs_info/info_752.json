            "How do I use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus to send and convert funds, including sending VRSCTEST from a single address or from all private wallet funds, and converting VRSCTEST to other currencies or reserves?",
            "The `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert funds in various ways. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST from a Single Address:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to the address `alice@`.\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST from All Private Wallet Funds:**\nTo send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to the addresses `alice@:private` and `bob@:private`.\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to a Fractional Basket Currency:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, such as VRSC-BTC, using IDs as a funding source, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to VRSC-BTC.\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to Another Reserve:**\nTo convert VRSCTEST to another reserve, such as BTC, through a fractional currency, such as VRSC-BTC, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to BTC through the fractional currency VRSC-BTC.\n\nIn general, the `sendcurrency` API allows you to specify the source of the funds, the recipient, the amount, and the currency or reserve to convert to. You can use IDs, friendly-name z-addresses, or private wallet funds as the funding source, and convert to various currencies or reserves.",
