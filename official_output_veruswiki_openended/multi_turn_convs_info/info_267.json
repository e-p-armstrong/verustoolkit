            "How do I create a commitment and register an identity on the Verus blockchain, and what are some basic operations I can perform with identities?",
            "To create a commitment and register an identity on the Verus blockchain, you need to follow a two-step process.\n\n**Step 1: Create a Commitment**\nFirst, you need to create a commitment using the `registernamecommitment` command. The format of this command is:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registernamecommitment <Name> <your_address_or_id> <referrer_friendly_name>@\n```\nReplace `<Name>` with the desired name for your identity, `<your_address_or_id>` with your Verus address or ID, and `<referrer_friendly_name>` with the friendly name of the referrer (if any).\n\nThis command will respond with a JSON object containing information about the commitment, including a transaction ID (`txid`), a name reservation, and other details.\n\n**Step 2: Register the Identity**\nOnce the commitment is mined into a block, you can register the identity using the `registeridentity` command. The format of this command is:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registeridentity <commitment_info>\n```\nReplace `<commitment_info>` with the JSON object returned in Step 1.\n\n**Basic Operations with Identities**\nAfter registering an identity, you can perform several basic operations:\n\n* **List Identities**: Use the `listidentities` command to list all identities in your wallet.\n* **Get Identity**: Use the `getidentity` command to display specific identity information.\n* **Revoke and Recover Identities**: If you have the necessary authority, you can revoke and recover identities using the `revokeidentity` and `recoveridentity` commands, respectively.\n\nNote that to perform these operations, you need to have sufficient funds and the necessary authority over the identities in question.",
            "Create your commitment with the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registernamecommitment Name youraddressorid referrerfriendlyname@\nThat will respond with something like:\n{\n \"txid\": \"377576f8ada1acc2aeb013ddf7a9ad86756cb990d4c5fc70b5a9a0fca43d727e\",\n \"namereservation\": {\n  \"name\": \"Name\",\n  \"salt\": \"7b981f0a1ff2593167ef078150d0116335a7f329f9403b0abaeca30a42d8876a\",\n  \"referral\": \"iSJLKp1hvn51Zg2Y6FBKjzLs9AAy7fomWN\",\n  \"parent\": \"\",\n  \"nameid\": \"iDXx9FPrAS5k2XCGss6FFmDQQMsts63uUg\"\n }\n}\n```\nYou then wait for the commitment to be mined into a block, then use the information returned above as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registeridentity '{\"txid\":\"377576f8ada1acc2aeb013ddf7a9ad86756cb990d4c5fc70b5a9a0fca43d727e\", \"namereservation\": {\n  \"name\": \"Name\", \"salt\": \"7b981f0a1ff2593167ef078150d0116335a7f329f9403b0abaeca30a42d8876a\", \"referral\":\"referrerfriendlyname@\"}, \"identity\":{\"name\":\"Name\", \"primaryaddresses\":[\"RKo5u8N1sStZu81fU8kaxhoDcFcJmNEwSp\"], \"minimumsignatures\":1, \"privateaddress\":\"zs14y0aa096em2as6n4fauyumqeywz45rfpze38c39fksgtjsac9vmms7fmstcylpaalm7rseu8838\"}}'\n```\nAs long as you have enough funds and you are registering a new identity on the blockchain, you will be able to use your new identity in place of an address as soon as the transaction created by the registration command is mined into the blockchain.\nYou may list the identities in your wallet with the command `listidentities`, and you may display specific identities with the command `getidentity`. If you have the authority, or use identities under your control as revocation or recovery authorities for other identities, you may also revoke and recovery identities as well.",
