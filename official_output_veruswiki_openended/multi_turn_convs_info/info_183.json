            "What are the key features and benefits of VerusIDs, and how do they enable secure and decentralized identity management on the Verus network?",
            "VerusIDs are a fundamental component of the Verus network, offering a range of features and benefits that enable secure and decentralized identity management. Here are some of the key aspects of VerusIDs:\n\n**Quantum-ready Friendly Crypto-addresses:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, with control over the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If the controlling addresses or properties are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity will follow the updated spend conditions and be subject to the updated keys. Although Verus currently does not include quantum-resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs themselves are resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms.\n\n**Fully Decentralized Protocol:** Anyone can create a VerusID and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without permission. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. This decentralized approach enables users to have full control over their identities and associated funds.\n\n**Revocable:** Each VerusID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. This authority has the permission to revoke the identity, creating a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered. This effectively freezes all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.\n\n**Additional Benefits:** VerusIDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains. However, only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, and inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\nOverall, VerusIDs offer a robust and decentralized approach to identity management, enabling users to have full control over their funds and identities while providing a range of security features to protect against potential threats.",
            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. VerusIDs are:- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.",
