            "How can I park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches, and later create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST?",
            "Verus provides a mechanism to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches, and later create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST. This is achieved through the use of the `sendcurrency` command.\n\n**Parking Conversion of VRSCTEST:**\nTo park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. For example, let's say you are parking conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token called `gold` before it launches. Here's the format you need to use:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"your_address@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\n**Creating a New Token (mycoin)**\nLater, if you want to create a new token called `mycoin` that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can do so by defining the currency's properties using the `definecurrency` command. Here's an example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\". Some important notes about this configuration:\n\n1. `proofprotocol` being set to 2 means that it's set to PROOF_CHAINID. This means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.\n2. `options` is a configurable integer, in this case set to 33.\n3. `currencies` lists which tokens can be converted to mycoin.\n4. `\"minpreconversion\": [10000,5.1298]` defines the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin, respectively.\n5. `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of mycoin to 20,000 units.\n\nBy following these steps, you can park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches, and later create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST.",
            "dcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
