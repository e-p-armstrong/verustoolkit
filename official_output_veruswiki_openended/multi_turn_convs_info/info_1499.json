            "What are some limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency features in Verus, and what are the implications of these limitations?",
            "When using the multi-currency features in Verus, there are some limitations to be aware of to avoid potential issues.\n\n**Limitation 1: IDs with i-addresses as names**\nIn Verus, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. While the protocol does not prevent creating an ID with an i-address as its name, it is not recommended as it can cause problems in various scenarios. To avoid confusion, the naming system will also expand the set of characters that are not allowed for currency registrations.\n\n**Limitation 2: Currency names already in use**\nIn the Verus Desktop, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you cannot use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is currently an erratum, but it will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\n**Disclaimer and Licensing**\nIt's essential to note that the Verus software is experimental and unfinished, and users should be aware that there is no warranty for any damage. However, the software is open-source, and users are permitted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software, as long as the enclosed copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.",
            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!
