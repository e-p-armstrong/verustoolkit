            "How do I define and launch a new currency on the Verus platform, and what are the requirements for launching a currency?",
            "To define and launch a new currency on the Verus platform, you need to use the `definecurrency` command. This command allows you to specify the properties of the new currency, such as its name, options, and conversion rates.\n\nHere's an example of how to define a new currency called \"gold\":\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new currency called \"gold\" with specific properties, such as a conversion rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD and a minimum preconversion amount of 1000 VRSCTEST.\n\nTo launch the currency, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST. Then, you need to send a transaction with the defined currency properties to initiate the currency launch. The launch will start 50 blocks from when the transaction was made, and it requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD.\n\nAfter the currency launches, you can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command will park your conversion until the token launches, and then you will either receive 0.975 GOLD in your wallet or have your VRSCTEST returned.\n\nIt's also possible to create new tokens that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. This is done by defining a new currency with the `definecurrency` command, specifying the conversion rates and other properties.\n\nNote that the launch of a currency is part of the mining process, and miners who participate in the launch earn a 0.025% conversion fee.",
            "./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
