            "What are the key features and benefits of the Verus public testnet, and how can it be used to create new blockchains and currencies with advanced functionality?",
            "The Verus public testnet is a decentralized platform that enables anyone to create new blockchains and currencies with advanced features and functionality. Some of the key benefits of the Verus public testnet include:\n\n* **Scale and operational independence**: Each blockchain and currency created on the testnet has its own scale and operational independence, allowing for flexible and customized use cases.\n* **zk-SNARK privacy**: The testnet provides zk-SNARK privacy, which allows for secure and private transactions.\n* **Automatic wallet support**: The testnet provides automatic wallet support, making it easy for users to manage their currencies and blockchain interactions.\n* **100% liquid conversion**: The testnet enables 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume, allowing for seamless and efficient conversions.\n* **Cross-chain interoperability**: The testnet enables cross-chain interoperability, allowing for easy conversions and interactions between different blockchains and currencies.\n* **Decentralized conversions**: All conversions on the testnet are fully decentralized, with a standard protocol fee of 0.01% that goes directly to miners and stakers of the network.\n* **PBaaS Reserve technology**: The testnet's PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization to create a fractional reserve currency on an independent blockchain with cross-chain interoperability.\n* **Merge mining**: Miners and stakers on the testnet have the option to merge mine up to 14 other blockchains and coins while mining their own project, improving efficiency, profitability, and shared liquidity for everyone involved.\n\nTo launch the testnet, users can simply run the command `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST`. When creating a new chain on the testnet, there are some important considerations to keep in mind, such as:\n\n* **Chain definition**: A chain definition is required, which includes a maximum of 3 eras, a minimum of 500 blocks worth of notarizations, and a minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.\n* **VRSCTEST requirements**: VRSCTEST are needed in the wallet to make a chain.\n\nOverall, the Verus public testnet provides a flexible and powerful platform for creating new blockchains and currencies with advanced functionality, and enables decentralized, secure, and efficient conversions and interactions between them.",
            "The Verus public testnet enables anyone to make new blockchains and currencies, each with scale and operational independence, zk-SNARK privacy, automatic wallet support, and 100% liquid conversion between VRSCTEST currency at any volume. Sending currencies cross-chain or converting between currencies is as easy as sending a cryptocurrency in less advanced systems today, except that the new Verus protocol enables you to include another blockchain as part of your destination and convert a fractional reserve currency to and from its reserve, according to its exact price along the way. All conversions are fully decentralized, require a standard protocol fee of 0.01%, which goes 100% to miners and stakers of the network, and calculates one price per block for all buys and sells in that block with zero spread.With no costs beyond public blockchain network fees, Verus PBaaS Reserve technology enables any organization of any size to make a fractional reserve currency of its own on an independent, uncluttered blockchain with cross-chain interoperability, and immediately useful for payments and conversion to other currencies from within the Verus wallet. 100% of the 0.01% fees for such conversions go directly to the miners and stakers of the organization's new chain, and those miners and stakers also have the option of merge mining up to 14 other blockchains and coins while mining their own project, improving efficiency, profitability, and shared liquidity for everyone involved. Each blockchain is independent and connected through the Verus Reserve protocol\n.\n**Launching the testnet:**\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST\n```# Chain definition:- Maximum of 3 eras\n- Minimum 500 blocks worth of notarizations.\n- Minimum of 0.01 VRSCTEST per block of notarization.\nVRSCTEST are needed in wallet to make a chain.",
