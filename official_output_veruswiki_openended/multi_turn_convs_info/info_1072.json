            "Verifying the authenticity and integrity of Verus downloads is crucial to ensure that you are getting the correct software without any malware or viruses. Here are the steps to follow:\n\n**Checking for Malware and Viruses:**\nBefore downloading Verus, you can check the VirusTotal links provided for each platform (MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows) to see if any antivirus software flags the download as malicious. Note that some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag Verus as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program), which is a warning that you are installing mining software that could be exploited by third parties.\n\n**Verifying Downloads:**\nTo verify the authenticity and integrity of Verus downloads, a `.txt` file is included with each download, containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". Here are the steps to verify the download:\n\n1. **Extract the downloaded archive**: Extract the downloaded archive to a folder on your computer.\n2. **Verify the signature for the extracted archive**: Use the extracted `.txt` file to verify the signature for the extracted archive. You can use the `./verus verifyfile` command to do this, specifying the signer's identity and the path to the extracted archive.\n3. **Extract the archive to the desired directory**: Once the signature has been verified, you can extract the archive to the desired directory on your computer.\n\n**CLI Examples:**\nHere are some CLI examples to illustrate the verification process:\n\n**Verifying a file directly:**\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AUo/FwABQR/8Mse5lnb7stZDIBtVu6/Wy3NyvKNKpyZv/2chp7bm1g9umtlqqpv6Zd3D8xMtLHjiOZpXgam8NpvR9g1WqvFO /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-4-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.3-4-x86_64.tar.gz\n```\n\n**Verifying using a checksum:**\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AUo/FwABQR/8Mse5lnb7stZDIBtVu6/Wy3NyvKNKpyZv/2chp7bm1g9umtlqqpv6Zd3D8xMtLHjiOZpXgam8NpvR9g1WqvFO 26b1c75156b4795505afc1236c1817bfa1dc15497d7ae952709b7345dd08659e\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that you are getting the correct Verus software without any malware or viruses.",
