            "What are the differences between Native IDs and IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies in terms of launching currencies and their other capabilities on the Verus platform?",
            "On the Verus platform, there are two types of IDs: Native IDs and IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies. Native IDs, which are registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, have the ability to launch currencies on that blockchain. In fact, if the Native ID is on the Verus blockchain, it can even launch independent blockchains. \n\nOn the other hand, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies. However, they are still valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs. They can also be used for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with various features such as identity, NFTs, proofs, brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login. Additionally, they have the ability to cross-prove common ownership with other IDs.\n\nThere is an exception to this rule, which is that *.veth gateway IDs will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter. These IDs will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. The registration of.veth IDs will be priced to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity.\n\nIn summary, Native IDs have more capabilities, including launching currencies and independent blockchains, while IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies have more limited capabilities, but are still valuable for other purposes.",

Registration of .veth IDs will be priced at a level to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.All of these features are currently enabled on the v0.9.2 new testnet. Stay connected on the #pbaas-development channel and participate in the launch at no actual cost as a testnet liquidity provider and get some nice testnet IDs, launch your own currencies, or start your exclusive ID-restricted club, governance group, or business.## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):",
