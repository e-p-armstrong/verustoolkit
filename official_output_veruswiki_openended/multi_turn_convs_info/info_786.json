            "The Verus protocol offers several key features that enable users to create their own decentralized tokens and blockchains, and provide a robust and secure decentralized system. \n\n**Multi-currency, user-created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains:**\nAny user with a Verus ID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can interact with the Verus chain. These blockchains, also known as PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) chains, are 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant, and can send and receive from the Verus chain that launched them. All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects can choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. This means they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n\n**Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets:**\nAny ID owner can define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers. This integration ensures smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n\n**Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches:**\nWhen defining a new blockchain, users can launch a world-class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, but are bound to the launch of the new blockchain and run on the new blockchain. This enables the creation of a robust and secure decentralized system with a high degree of flexibility and customization.",
