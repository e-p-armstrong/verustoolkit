            "How do I register an identity on the Verus network, and what are some limitations I should be aware of when creating a currency from an ID?",
            "To register an identity on the Verus network, you can use the `registeridentity` command. The basic format of this command is:\n```\nverus -chain=<chain_name> registeridentity <identity_json> <returntx> <fee>\n```\nHere, `<chain_name>` is the name of the chain you want to register the identity on, `<identity_json>` is a JSON object containing the identity information, `<returntx>` is a boolean indicating whether to return the raw transaction for signing, and `<fee>` is the fee for the transaction.\n\nThe `<identity_json>` object should contain the following information:\n* `txid`: the transaction ID of the name reservation transaction\n* `namereservation`: a JSON object containing the name reservation information, including the version, name, parent, salt, and referral\n* `identity`: a JSON object containing the identity information, including the primary addresses, minimum signatures, name, and parent\n\nFor example:\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest registeridentity '{\"txid\": \"67635331cbccb7a2cbf408a9e97b3f8986133964e0315a8b9fd237a5fd95ac8f\",\"namereservation\": { \"version\": 1, \"name\": \"ID\", \"parent\": \"i84mndBk2Znydpgm9T9pTjVvBnHkhErzLt\", \"salt\": \"b7070f2ca7495e49c85ab41b5a368150e2c217be6d08cc4102a1b682cddb6f01\", \"referral\": \"\"},\"identity\":{\"primaryaddresses\":[\"RDnf7mH7RQki9b7PqdBD2Er6WXv3DTawGr\"],\"minimumsignatures\":1,\"name\":\"ID\",\"parent\":\"vrsc-btc@\"}}' false 0 zs1s2mteau9tcalvk55cnepw3aq7dr6w7f447pqqkxczat3a02208d3ersx60wz9srw3nkd25ppfny\n```\nAdditionally, it's important to be aware of some limitations when creating a currency from an ID:\n* You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because the naming system will interpret the i-address as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration, rather than the ID itself. To avoid confusion, it's generally recommended to avoid using an i-address as the name of an ID.\n* The protocol does not prevent creating an ID with an i-address as its name, but this will cause problems in many cases and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce the potential for user confusion, the set of characters that are not allowed for currency registrations will be expanded.",

Either use the parent identity to fund those transactions, or receive a raw transaction to give the identity owner to sign by setting `returntx` to `true`#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.",
