            "What are the different types of addresses in Verus, and how can I use them? Specifically, what are the differences between `getnewaddress`, `getrawchangeaddress`, and `getreceivedbyaccount` commands?",
            "In Verus, there are several types of addresses that serve different purposes. Here, we'll explore the `getnewaddress`, `getrawchangeaddress`, and `getreceivedbyaccount` commands, which help you manage and interact with these addresses.\n\n**`getnewaddress` Command:**\nThe `getnewaddress` command generates a new, unique VRSC address. This address can be used to receive VRSC coins. Note that if you pass an argument to this command, it must be an empty string (`\"\"`), which represents the default account. Any other string will result in an error. The resulting address can be used for normal transactions.\n\n**`getrawchangeaddress` Command:**\nThe `getrawchangeaddress` command returns a new VRSC address, but this one is specifically designed for receiving change in raw transactions. This command is not intended for normal use and is only meant for advanced users who work with raw transactions.\n\n**`getreceivedbyaccount` Command (Deprecated):**\nThe `getreceivedbyaccount` command is deprecated and should not be used. It was previously used to retrieve the total amount of VRSC received by addresses associated with a specific account, with a minimum number of confirmations. However, this command is no longer supported, and you should avoid using it.\n\nIn summary, `getnewaddress` generates a new address for normal transactions, `getrawchangeaddress` generates a new address for raw transactions, and `getreceivedbyaccount` is a deprecated command that should not be used. Understanding the differences between these commands will help you manage your VRSC addresses more effectively.",
