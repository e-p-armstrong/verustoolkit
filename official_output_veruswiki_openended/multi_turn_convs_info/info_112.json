            "What are some of the additional capabilities of Verus, and how do they improve the user experience?",
            "Verus offers several additional capabilities that enhance its functionality and user experience. These capabilities include:\n\n**On-chain Launches and Interoperability**: Verus allows for the on-chain launch of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs, as well as the launch and merge mining of independent, connected, and interoperable blockchains without the need for programming. This enables seamless interactions between different blockchain networks and applications.\n\n**Verus ID and NFT Marketplace**: The Verus ID and NFT marketplace enables users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain, in a completely decentralized manner. This allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries, while still providing transparency and auditability. Users can advertise their offers directly to ID or NFT owners, or post their sales on the worldwide blockchain for everyone to see.\n\n**Verus Vault**: Verus Vault is a security feature that protects funds on a VerusID, even in the event of private key theft. By locking a VerusID with Vault, users can prevent funds from being spent until the ID is unlocked. Meanwhile, users can still stake their funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. To use Verus Vault, users must have at least one primary identity and one revocation/recovery ID configured.\n\nThese capabilities demonstrate Verus' commitment to providing a robust, secure, and decentralized platform for users to manage their digital identities, assets, and transactions. By offering advanced features like on-chain launches, interoperability, and decentralized marketplaces, Verus enables a new level of flexibility, security, and autonomy for its users.",

Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.#### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.",
