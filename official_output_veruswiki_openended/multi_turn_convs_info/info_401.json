            "How does Verus enable decentralized buying and selling of VerusIDs and NFTs, and what is Verus Vault, which seems to add an additional layer of security to VerusIDs?",
            "Verus allows for decentralized buying and selling of VerusIDs and NFTs through its on-chain marketplace. This means that users can advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for anyone to see. The transactions are executed in a completely decentralized manner, allowing buyers and sellers to interact directly without the need for intermediaries. The payments can be made from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, which are still auditable by the user. Additionally, sellers can choose to share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in the new economy of provable digital ownership.\n\nVerus Vault is an additional feature that allows users to protect their funds on a VerusID, even in the event of private key theft. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the user cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. However, they can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. The user can also still receive funds while the VerusID is locked. To take advantage of Verus Vault's capabilities, users need to have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This adds an extra layer of security to VerusIDs, giving users more control over their funds and identities.",
            "#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.#### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.",
