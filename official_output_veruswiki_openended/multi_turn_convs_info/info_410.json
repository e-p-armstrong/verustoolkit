            "What are the limitations in creating multi-currency systems in Verus, and what precautions should be taken when upgrading to a new version of the Verus testnet?",
            "When working with multi-currency systems in Verus, there are a few limitations to be aware of:\n\n1. **Naming Conflicts:** You cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name. This is because an i-address will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. To avoid any potential user confusion, the naming system will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.\n\nAdditionally, there is a limitation specific to the GUI (Graphical User Interface) version of Verus:\n\n2. **Reserved Currency Names:** If a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same names as a PBaaS chain.\n\nIt's also important to note that if you are upgrading to a new version of the Verus testnet, you will need to take precautions to ensure a smooth transition. Specifically, if you have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this, you will need to delete certain directories before running the new update. These directories are:\n- On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n- On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n- On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\n\nBy being aware of these limitations and taking the necessary precautions, you can ensure a successful experience with Verus multi-currency systems.",
            "## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on this release. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/vrsctest\n```**MacOS**\n```\n \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest\n```**Windows**\n```\n\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST\n```# Disclaimer",
