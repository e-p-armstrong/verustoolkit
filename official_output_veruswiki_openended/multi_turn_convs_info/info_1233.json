            "How do I launch a new currency on the Verus platform, and what are the requirements for launching a new currency?",
            "To launch a new currency on the Verus platform, you need to follow a specific process. First, you must fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction to initiate the currency launch. The launch will start 50 blocks from when the transaction was made, which is the default setting. Additionally, you must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch the currency.\n\nThis process is part of the mining process, and miners who mine the blocks that launch a currency will earn 0.025% conversion fees for their participation in the launch. These fees are earned by converting VRSCTEST to GOLD.\n\nBefore the block where the GOLD token launches, you can send a command to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will effectively park your conversion until the token launches. Once the token launches, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.\n\nAfter the currency launches, you can create a new token, such as mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. To create mycoin, you can use a command such as:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\" with specific properties, such as the currencies that can be converted to mycoin, the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to mycoin, and the initial supply of mycoin.",
            "urrency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option.
