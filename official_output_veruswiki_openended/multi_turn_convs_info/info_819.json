            "What should I do when I encounter warnings from Avast or Kaspersky about Verus software being flagged as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\", and how can I verify the authenticity of the Verus CLI downloads?",
            "When you download Verus software, you might encounter warnings from Avast or Kaspersky about the software being flagged as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software may be used for cryptocurrency mining, which can be exploited by third parties to misuse your computer's resources. However, these warnings do not necessarily mean that the software is malicious.\n\nTo ensure the authenticity of the Verus CLI downloads, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Extract the downloaded archive**: First, extract the contents of the downloaded archive file.\n2. **Verify the signature**: Next, verify the signature of the extracted archive using the provided text file. This file contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. The packages are signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\".\n3. **Verify using CLI commands**: You can use the Verus CLI to verify the file directly or using a checksum. For direct verification, use the command `./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <path_to_archive>`. For verification using a checksum, use the command `./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" <signature> <checksum>`. If the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that the Verus CLI software you download is authentic and has not been tampered with.",
