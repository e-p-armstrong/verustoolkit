            "What are some important considerations when evaluating a basket currency, and what are some additional capabilities that the Verus network offers?",
            "When evaluating a basket currency, it's essential to consider several factors to ensure it's a viable and sustainable option. Firstly, examine the total reserve ratio to understand the underlying assets backing the basket. Secondly, review the currencies included in the basket and their liquidity to assess the basket's overall stability. Additionally, investigate the distribution of reserves and holders to ensure a diverse and healthy ecosystem.\n\nIt's also crucial to comprehend how the basket operates and whether it has a valid purpose, rather than simply being a meme or speculative instrument. This due diligence will help you make informed decisions when deciding whether to invest your Verus in a basket currency.\n\nRegarding additional capabilities, the Verus network offers a range of features that set it apart from other blockchain platforms. One of these capabilities is the on-chain launch of token, centralized currency, and liquidity basket AMMs (Automated Market Makers). This allows for the creation and deployment of decentralized exchanges and liquidity pools directly on the Verus blockchain.\n\nAnother key feature is the ability to launch and merge mine independent, connected, and interoperable blockchains without requiring programming knowledge. This enables the creation of a network of interconnected blockchains, each with its own unique characteristics and use cases.\n\nFurthermore, Verus offers on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles. This allows users to create and manage their own identities, store and manage digital assets, and interact with other users and organizations in a decentralized and secure manner.\n\nOverall, the Verus network provides a robust and feature-rich ecosystem that enables users to create, deploy, and interact with a wide range of blockchain-based applications and services.",
            "The lesson here is that if you\u2019re interested to learn about a basket currency, pay attention to the total reserve ratio, what currencies are in it, and see that there is enough liquidity of reserves and holder distribution for the basket to make sense. Of course baskets could be memes, but they also have real function. Make sure you take a look into how a basket works and that you have a reason before putting your hard mined, staked, won, or purchased Verus in.We will need the network to upgrade to version 1.0.6 before we can re-enable DeFi and cross-chain functions, making the ETH bridge launch possible, as well as PBaaS launches and conversions.We see that someone is launching a currency called \u201cwhales\u201d, which looks like an ID registration currency that will enable registering IDs with 3 levels of referrals in a currency that simply collects registration fees, which may start quite reasonably priced and likely get more expensive over time as fees are earned in the basket. The startblock for whales is 2561900, which should happen somewhere around 6:00 UTC on Thursday. That means that if we can upgrade and activate by Tuesday before the meeting, that person would still have time for pre-launch participation by those who would like.Thanks everyone for upgrading as soon as you are able!### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
