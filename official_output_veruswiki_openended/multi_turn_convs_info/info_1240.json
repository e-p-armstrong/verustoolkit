            "What are the `convertpassphrase` and `decryptdata` commands in Verus, and how do they work?",
            "The `convertpassphrase` and `decryptdata` commands are two important functions in Verus that help users manage their wallet and encrypted data.\n\n**`convertpassphrase` Command:**\nThe `convertpassphrase` command is used to convert a wallet passphrase into a Verus address, public key, private key, and WIF (Wallet Import Format) key. This command takes a single argument, which is the wallet passphrase. The output of this command includes:\n\n* The wallet passphrase itself\n* The corresponding Verus address\n* The public key in hexadecimal format\n* The private key in hexadecimal format\n* The WIF key, which can be used to import the private key into other Verus-compatible wallets\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `convertpassphrase` command:\n```bash\n> verus convertpassphrase \"walletpassphrase\"\n```\n**`decryptdata` Command:**\nThe `decryptdata` command is used to decrypt a vdxf data descriptor, which is typically encrypted to a z-address. This command takes a JSON object as an argument, which contains the encrypted data descriptor. If either the viewing key or the spending key (ssk) is correct, the object will be returned with as much decryption as possible. If no decryption is possible, this function returns an error.\n\nThe `decryptdata` command is used to decrypt data that has been encrypted using Verus's encryption features. This allows users to access their encrypted data using their viewing key or spending key.\n\nNote that these commands are part of the Verus wallet and are used to manage and manipulate wallet data. They are essential tools for anyone using Verus to manage their cryptocurrencies.",
