            "Verus provides a range of features that enable the creation of new tokens and blockchain networks, as well as advanced management of identities and conversions between currencies.\n\n**Token Launches and Blockchain Networks:**\nVerus allows for the creation of new tokens through a process that includes carve-outs of proceeds, pre-launch discounts for early participants, and vesting schedules in the pre-allocations using VerusIDs. Additionally, Verus enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network, each with its own decentralized bridge confirmation provided by Notary IDs. This allows for public blockchains to be merge-mined and staked, as well as private, internal blockchains that can easily bridge public currencies into an organization's internal network.\n\n**Identity Management:**\nVerus provides advanced identity management features, including time locking and unlocking of IDs. Time locking allows an ID to be locked until a specified block height, using the `setidentitytimelock` command with the `unlockatblock` parameter. Time delay allows for an ID's unlock to be delayed by a specified number of blocks, using the `setidentitytimelock` command with the `setunlockdelay` parameter. Revoking an identity clears its locked status, regardless of the time delay or unlock height, and a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**Conversion Queries:**\nVerus also provides a `getcurrencyconverters` API that retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve and are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio. This enables users to easily query and convert between different currencies on the Verus network.\n\nOverall, Verus provides a powerful and flexible platform for creating new tokens and blockchain networks, managing identities, and converting between currencies. Its features enable a wide range of use cases and unlimited scale, making it an attractive option for developers and organizations looking to build on the blockchain.",

Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n#### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n The unlockatblock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"unlockatblock\": <Unlock block height>}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\n The setunlockdelay parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST setidentitytimelock \"id@\" '{\"setunlockdelay\": <Unlock block delay>}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve rati",
