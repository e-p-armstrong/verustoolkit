            "What is Verus Vault, and how does it provide a decentralized solution to common forms of crypto loss or theft, including the 5-dollar wrench attack?",
            "Verus Vault is a decentralized solution that provides an additional layer of security and protection for your funds, IDs, and NFTs on the Verus blockchain. It achieves this by introducing a concept called \"locked VerusIDs\", which can be revoked and recovered by designated revocation and recovery authority identities.\n\nHere's how it works: when a VerusID is locked, it cannot be spent or accessed by anyone with the primary keys, including a multisig of primary keys, until a predetermined unlock time has passed. This creates a time delay that allows the revocation authority to detect and respond to any unauthorized unlock attempts.\n\nIn the event of an unauthorized unlock, the revocation authority can revoke the ID and recover the funds, effectively circumventing the lock. This provides a decentralized solution to the infamous 5-dollar wrench attack, where an attacker attempts to force a victim to reveal their private keys.\n\nVerus Vault also extends this security feature to other use cases, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. It provides a way to protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, without the need for a traditional bank.\n\nIn addition, Verus Vault allows for the exporting of IDs to PBaaS chains, providing a seamless way to move assets between different blockchain ecosystems. This is achieved using the `sendcurrency` command, which enables the export of IDs to a PBaaS chain.\n\nOverall, Verus Vault offers a robust and decentralized solution for protecting your digital assets on the Verus blockchain, providing an additional layer of security and peace of mind for users.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",
