            "What are some key features of VerusIDs, and how does the VerusHash algorithm work to equalize performance between FPGAs and CPUs?",
            "VerusIDs have several key features that make them powerful and flexible. Two of these features are recoverability and privacy.\n\n**Recoverability:** Each VerusID includes a separate recovery authority, which defaults to the ID itself. This recovery authority can recover the identity by redefining its primary state and recovery state. However, it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.\n\n**Privacy:** Each VerusID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. Additionally, each ID contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations. This means that VerusIDs can be used to store and manage sensitive information in a private and secure way.\n\nNow, let's talk about the VerusHash algorithm. VerusHash is a hash algorithm that is designed to equalize performance between Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and Central Processing Units (CPUs). The goal of VerusHash is to prevent FPGAs from dominating CPUs in terms of performance, which could lead to an unfair advantage in mining and staking.\n\n**VerusHash 2.1:** The latest version of the VerusHash algorithm, VerusHash 2.1, introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology. This adjustment is expected to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. The Verus developers have made the new algorithm available to FPGA manufacturers, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll.\n\nIn general, the VerusHash algorithm is designed to be fair and inclusive, allowing both CPUs and FPGAs to participate in the Verus network. By equalizing performance between these two types of hardware, VerusHash helps to prevent any one group from dominating the network and ensures that everyone has an opportunity to participate.",
            "- **Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.- **Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.\n# VerusHash 2.1\nVerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.\n# Disclaimer",
