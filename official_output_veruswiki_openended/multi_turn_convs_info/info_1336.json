            "How do I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus network, and what is the significance of the new Verus testnet?",
            "To sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus network, you need to follow a specific process. First, create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using the `verus sendcurrency` command. Then, use the `verus z_getoperationstatus` command to get the operation ID and raw hex transaction data. Take this raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it using the `verus signrawtransaction` command. Once the last necessary signature is applied, broadcast the transaction on the network using the `verus sendrawtransaction` command.\n\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that allows users to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming. It enables users to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease, and even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange. The testnet is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets and marks the beginning of a new age in crypto. With Verus, users can do many things that are not possible with other cryptocurrency platforms, such as creating multiple identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains, and sending currencies worldwide across different chains.",
