            "What are the different options available for fundraising during a blockchain launch on the Verus platform, and how do they work?",
            "During a blockchain launch on the Verus platform, there are several options available for fundraising. These options allow the launching identity to receive funds in exchange for the newly created native currency, which is used to operate the proof of stake of the blockchain. Here's a detailed explanation of each option:\n\n**Fractionally Backed Currency:**\nWhen a blockchain launch uses fundraising options, the newly created native currency is fractionally backed. This means that the currency's value will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more people convert from it.\n\n**Pre-Launch Discount:**\nOne fundraising option is to offer a pre-launch discount to participants who contribute to the launch before it goes live on its start block. This discount is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency remains in demand when it launches.\n\n**Pre-Launch Carve-Out:**\nAnother option is the pre-launch carve-out, which allows a percentage of each initial participation currency to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price-neutral manner. This carved-out amount is sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch.\n\n**Pre-Allocation:**\nPre-allocation is another fundraising option that enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price-neutral manner, and the allocated amount is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time-locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods.\n\nIt's worth noting that if a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options not being met, no fundraising is received.",

If a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options that are not met, no fundraising is received:\n - Pre-launch discount - all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block get a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency. This is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency would still be in demand when it goes live.\n- Pre-launch carve-out - this enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch.\n- Pre-allocation - this enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price neutral manner, and again is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods.",
