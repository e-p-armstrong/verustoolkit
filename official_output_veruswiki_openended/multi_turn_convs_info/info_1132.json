            "How do NFT mapped tokens work on Verus, and what are their benefits? Additionally, how do you define a token for ID control using the command line?",
            "NFT mapped tokens on Verus allow you to define an Ethereum NFT as the token that controls revoke and recover for an ID. This means that you can use an Ethereum NFT to manage the permissions and access to a specific ID or sub-ID on the Verus blockchain. The NFT mapped token is linked to a specific NFT on the Ethereum blockchain by contract and token ID.\n\nOnce defined as the currency for a specific ID or sub-ID, the Ethereum NFT can be sent to any address or ID on the Verus blockchain as a satoshi of that currency. This allows for trustless exchange on the Verus on-chain P2P marketplace, and the NFT can be used to revoke and recover the ID that defined the token.\n\nThe benefits of NFT mapped tokens on Verus include:\n\n* Protecting your NFTs with VerusID's revoke and recover technology\n* Binding your NFT to a pseudonymous ID used to log into applications\n* Extending and publishing more than just the NFT itself\n\nTo define a token for ID control using the command line, you can use the `definecurrency` command with the `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` and `OPTION_TOKEN` flags, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre-allocated or pre-converted to. Here's an example of how to define a token called \"ID\" with a pre-allocation of 0.00000001 satoshis:\n\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new token called \"ID\" with a maximum supply of 1 satoshi, which is pre-allocated to the address `ControlTokenRecipient@`.",
            "NFT mapped tokens will allow you to define an Ethereum NFT as the token that controls revoke and recover for an ID. Similar to how you can define a token for tokenized ID control, an NFT mapped token, when defined, refers by contract and tokenid to a specific NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. Once defined as the currency for a specific ID or sub-ID and linked to the Ethereum NFT, that NFT will be able to be sent over from the Ethereum blockchain as a satoshi of that currency, sent to any address or ID on the Verus blockchain, exchanged trustlessly on the Verus on-chain P2P marketplace, and used to revoke and recover the ID which defined the token. Once the contracts are updated, you will be able to mint NFTs on Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet, and endow your Ethereum NFTs with all of the power of your specially named VerusID. This new technology allows you to protect your NFTs with VerusID\u2019s revoke and recover technology, bind your NFT to the pseudonymous ID you use to log into applications, use it to extend and publish much more than just the NFT, and generally take your Ethereum NFTs to the next level!The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. Drop by the #pbaas-development channel to help us prepare for mainnet and start building your vision today!### Tokenizing ID control (next generation NFT):\nThe currency definition have flags OPTION_NFT_TOKEN + OPTION_TOKEN, and a max supply of 1 satoshi that is either pre allocated or pre-converted to. If the token is pre-allocated, then the maximum pre-conversion must be 0.\n```\nverus -chain=vrsctest definecurrency '{\"name\":\"ID\",\"options\":2080,\"preallocations\":[{\"ControlTokenRecipient@\":0.00000001}],\"maxpreconversion\":[0]}'\n```",
