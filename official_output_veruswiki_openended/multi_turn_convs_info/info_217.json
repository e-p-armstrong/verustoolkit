            "What are VerusIDs, and what features do they have that make them secure and flexible, especially in terms of controlling funds and protecting against quantum attacks?",
            "VerusIDs are quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network. They can be used to receive and send funds, and are controlled by single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. Here are some key features of VerusIDs:\n\n**Controlling Funds:** The controlling addresses or single/multi-sig properties of a VerusID can be changed by the controller of the identity. If this happens, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity will follow the updated spend conditions and be subject to the updated keys.\n\n**Quantum Resistance:** Although Verus currently does not have quantum-resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs themselves are resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms. Additionally, a quantum-secure signature scheme is being integrated, which will allow VerusIDs to be retroactively quantum-resistant when it is activated.\n\n**Decentralized Protocol:** Anyone can create a VerusID and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without needing permission. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\n\n**Revocability:** Each VerusID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self. This authority can revoke the identity, creating a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered. This effectively freezes all of its funds, which is useful in cases like key theft.\n\nOverall, VerusIDs offer a high level of security, flexibility, and control over funds, making them a powerful tool for users on the Verus network.",
            "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. VerusIDs are:- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.",
