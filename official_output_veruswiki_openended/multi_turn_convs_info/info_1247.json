            "What is the purpose of the Verus Vault feature, and how does it provide theft-resistant protection for funds controlled by an ID?",
            "The Verus Vault feature allows users to timelock an ID, which prevents any spending of funds controlled by that ID while still allowing the ID and its funds to be used for staking. This means that even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds without first unlocking the ID and waiting for the specified waiting period to pass. This provides an additional layer of security and protection against theft.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Timelocking an ID**: You can timelock an ID, which prevents any spending of funds controlled by that ID. This ensures that even if someone gains access to your private keys, they cannot spend your funds.\n2. **Unlocking an ID**: To unlock an ID, you need to wait for the specified waiting period to pass. This waiting period is set when you timelock the ID. For example, if you set the timelock for one day, you will need to wait one day to unlock the ID.\n3. **Protection against theft**: Even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds. They would need to unlock the ID first and wait for the waiting period to pass. If you notice that your ID has been unlocked by someone other than you, you can revoke and recover before any funds are lost.\n4. **Additional security measures**: To further enhance security, you can modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it. This ensures that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys.\n\nOverall, the Verus Vault feature provides a theft-resistant protection mechanism for funds controlled by an ID. While it's not foolproof, it significantly reduces the risk of theft and provides an additional layer of security for users.",
            "The Verus Vault use case, which was originally described in the conception of the feature, is the ability to timelock an ID, which would prevent any spending of any funds controlled by that ID, while still allowing the ID and all its funds to be used for staking. If the timelock was set for one day when locked, the unlock operation itself will require a waiting period of one day, which can only be circumvented by a revocation followed by recovery operation. In practice, this means that even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds (though they could stake them and delegate rewards to another address, which you could immediately see) unless they unlock the ID first and wait one day. If you notice that your ID has been unlocked by someone other than you, you can revoke and recover before any funds are lost at all. If you wanted to get extremely secure, to the point of covering a case where someone may steal your private keys without you knowing and then lay in wait until you unlock your identity, so they can pounce on your funds before you lock it again, you can actually modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it, which ensures that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys. While we believe this unique Verus technology actually provides for fully theft-proof workflows and protection of all assets on the network under the control of an ID, we will generally refer to the technology as \"theft-resistant\" and disclaim all guarantees of fitness for any particular purpose as part of the \"experimental software\" disclaimer.",
