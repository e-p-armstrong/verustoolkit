            "How do Verus IDs work, and what are the benefits of acquiring one, especially in terms of the network's economy and potential rewards for miners, stakers, and referrers?",
            "Verus IDs are a crucial component of the Verus ecosystem, and they come with a unique set of benefits and incentives. To acquire a Verus ID, you need to pay a fee of 100 Verus, which can be discounted to 80 Verus if you're referred by an existing Verus ID holder. The interesting aspect of this system is that the entire cost of an ID is redistributed back into the network, benefiting miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\n\nHere's how the referral system works:\n\n* When someone purchases an ID using your referral, they receive a 20% discount (80 Verus instead of 100).\n* You, as the referrer, receive 20 Verus directly.\n* The person who referred you, if there is one, also receives 20 Verus.\n* The person who referred the person who referred you, if there is one, receives 20 Verus as well.\n* The remaining 40 Verus (discounted from 80) goes to the miner or staker who validated the transaction.\n\nThis system has a significant impact on the Verus network's economy. Since a substantial portion of the ID cost goes to miners and stakers, some Verus blocks may have extremely high rewards for a period. The best part is that these rewards are generated by the on-chain economy, without inflating the money supply.\n\nIn essence, the Verus ID system creates a win-win situation for everyone involved. ID holders benefit from the discounts and potential revenue streams, while miners and stakers receive additional rewards for their contributions to the network. If you're interested in mining, staking, or referring others, now is an excellent time to participate in the Verus ecosystem.",
            "Verus IDs will cost Verus to acquire, 100 Verus per ID to be exact, which can be discounted to 80 Verus with referral of an existing Verus ID. The interesting twist is that all of the cost of an ID goes back into the network, either as referral fees, which are a way to get discounts or possibly even make money through referrals and built into the identity transactions themselves, or as mining and staking fees. No one besides people participating in the network as miners, stakers, or ID referrers take any proceeds from the cost of an identity. If you refer someone new and they purchase an ID with your ID as a referral, they will receive a 20% discount on the ID. In addition:1. You will receive 20 Verus directly\n2. The person who referred you, if there is one, will receive 20 Verus\n3. The person who referred person b, if there is one, will receive 20 Verus, and\n3. The miner or staker will receive the remainder of the discounted 80 Verus costAs you might expect from looking at the fact that anywhere from 20 to 100 Verus goes to miners and stakers of Verus for each new identity once identities hit mainnet, some Verus blocks may have VERY high rewards for some time. The best thing about that is that regardless of how much the Verus blockchain rewards miners over and above the pre-determined coinbase reward, it will be as a result of the **on-chain economy**, paid for by people buying identities with **no inflation** of the money supply\\! If you or your friends missed the early days of the Verus launch, **you don't want to miss this** new opportunity to be mining, staking or referring now **Verus IDs are activated on the mainnet\\!**.## VerusPay#### Blockchain-integrated payment gateway for accepting Verus Coin (VRSC) in a WooCommerce ecommerce store",
