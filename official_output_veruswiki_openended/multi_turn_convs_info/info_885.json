            "What are some limitations and considerations I should be aware of when working with multi-currency functionality in Verus, and what are the implications of these limitations?",
            "When working with multi-currency functionality in Verus, there are some important limitations and considerations to be aware of.\n\n**Limitation 1: Using i-addresses as IDs**\nIn Verus, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but it will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used, and it will not be supported for creating currencies. To avoid any potential user confusion, the naming system will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.\n\n**Limitation 2: Reserved Currency Names (GUI only)**\nIn the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same names as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is currently under development and will be resolved before the mainnet release.\n\n**Disclaimer and License**\nIt is essential to note that the software is experimental and unfinished, and users should use it at their own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage. The software is licensed under an open-source license, which allows users to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, subject to certain conditions, including the inclusion of the copyright notice and permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n\nThese limitations and considerations are crucial to keep in mind when working with multi-currency functionality in Verus to ensure a smooth and successful experience.",
            "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!
