            "What are the current developments and opportunities in the Verus PBaaS and DeFi protocols, and how can I participate and contribute to their testing and development?",
            "The Verus PBaaS and DeFi protocols are currently in their testing phase, and the community is encouraged to participate in testing and development. The protocol developers are confident in the stability and functionality of the protocols, but they are still seeking community involvement to identify any potential issues or bugs before the mainnet release.\n\nTo participate, you can join the pbaas-development channel and start building your vision today. The Verus Coin Foundation is offering bug bounties for the first 10 people to report any actual protocol bugs before mainnet release, with rewards ranging from 500 VRSC to 10,000 VRSC for serious security issues.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to reset your testnet, you can do so by deleting specific directories and restarting the testnet daemon or relaunching Verus Desktop. The directories to delete vary depending on your operating system, and can be found in the Verus documentation.\n\nBy participating in the testing and development of the Verus PBaaS and DeFi protocols, you can help shape the future of decentralized finance and contribute to the growth of the Verus ecosystem.",
            "The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for the imminent mainnet release of the PBaaS upgrade and start building your vision today!\n## Verus PBaaS and DeFi RC5 - BUG BOUNTIES\nAt this time, we are not aware of any bugs or errors in the DeFi, ID, or PBaaS cross chain protocols on this version of testnet. We do not anticipate any changes to the PBaaS protocol before mainnet release, and we hope you will join us on testnet trying out all of the incredible capabilities and looking for any potential, remaining issues that can possibly be found before mainnet release. While we don\u2019t expect it to be easy to find bugs in the protocol, The Verus Coin Foundation is offering a bounty of at least 500 VRSC (possibly more for security related reports) for the first 10 people (7 still unclaimed) who are first to report any actual protocol bug before mainnet release, meaning failure of a properly executed command or API on a functioning VRSCTEST or PBaaS chain to function as intended. If anyone is first to find and describe the exploit for an exploitable security hole in any part of the protocol, the bounty will be a minimum of 1,000 VRSC, and for a serious potential security issue, 10,000 $VRSC.## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):- Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`",
