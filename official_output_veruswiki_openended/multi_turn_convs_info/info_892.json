            "How do I prepare for and initiate a currency launch on the Verus network, and what are the requirements and consequences of doing so?",
            "To initiate a currency launch on the Verus network, you need to prepare by funding the relevant address with at least 10 VRSCTEST and preconverting a certain amount of VRSCTEST to the new currency. In this example, we'll use GOLD as the new currency.\n\nThe launch process is tied to the mining process, where mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. To prepare for the launch, you can send a command before the block where the GOLD token launches, specifying the conversion details.\n\nFor instance, to convert 100 VRSCTEST to GOLD at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD, you would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command effectively parks your conversion until the token launches. Once the token launches, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet or you will have your VRSCTEST back.\n\nAfter the launch, you can create new tokens that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. To do this, you would define the new token's properties, such as its name, options, proof protocol, currencies, and initial supply, using the `definecurrency` command.\n\nNote that the launch process requires a certain amount of VRSCTEST to be preconverted to the new currency, and that the conversion fees are earned by miners who participate in the launch. Additionally, the only way to create new tokens after the launch is through a centralized issuance option.",
