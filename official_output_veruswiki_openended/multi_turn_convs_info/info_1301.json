            "How do I list transactions and unspent transaction outputs using the Verus command line tool and JSON RPC calls?",
            "To list transactions and unspent transaction outputs using Verus, you can use the `listtransactions` and `listunspent` commands. Here's how:\n\n**Listing Transactions:**\nThe `listtransactions` command is used to list transactions in the system. You can use it in different ways to filter the transactions.\n\nTo list the most recent 10 transactions, you can simply run:\n```\nverus listtransactions\n```\nIf you want to list transactions within a specific range, you can specify the count and the starting point. For example, to list transactions 100 to 120, you can run:\n```\nverus listtransactions \"*\" 20 100\n```\nThis command will list 20 transactions starting from the 100th transaction.\n\nYou can also use JSON RPC calls to list transactions. Here's an example:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"listtransactions\", \"params\": [\"*\", 20, 100] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\n**Listing Unspent Transaction Outputs:**\nThe `listunspent` command is used to list unspent transaction outputs with a specified number of confirmations. You can use it to filter outputs by confirmation count and address.\n\nThe basic syntax of the `listunspent` command is:\n```\nverus listunspent minconf maxconf [\"address\",...] [includeshared]\n```\nHere, `minconf` and `maxconf` specify the minimum and maximum number of confirmations, and `address` is an optional parameter to filter outputs by address. `includeshared` is a boolean parameter that specifies whether to include shared outputs.\n\nThe command returns an array of objects, each of which has the following properties:\n* `txid`: the transaction ID\n* `vout`: the output number\n* `scriptPubKey`: the script public key\n* `amount`: the amount of the output\n* `confirmations`: the number of confirmations\n\nFor example, to list unspent transaction outputs with between 10 and 20 confirmations, you can run:\n```\nverus listunspent 10 20\n```\nTo list unspent transaction outputs with between 10 and 20 confirmations and paid to a specific address, you can run:\n```\nverus listunspent 10 20 [\"myaddress@\"]\n```\nNote that you can use JSON RPC calls to list unspent transaction outputs as well. The syntax is similar to the `listtransactions` command.",
            "Examples:List the most recent 10 transactions in the systems\n```bash\n> verus listtransactions\n```\nList transactions 100 to 120\n```bash\n> verus listtransactions \"*\" 20 100\n```\nAs a json rpc call\n```bash\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"listtransactions\", \"params\": [\"*\", 20, 100] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```### `listunspent ( minconf maxconf [\"address\",...] inludeshared )`\nReturns array of unspent transaction outputs with between minconf and maxconf (inclusive) confirmations.\nOptionally filter to only include txouts paid to specified addresses.\nResults are an array of Objects, each of which has:\n{txid, vout, scriptPubKey, amount, confirmations}",
