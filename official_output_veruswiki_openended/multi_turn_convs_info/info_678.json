            "Is mining Verus Coin (VRSC) with Verushash profitable, and what factors do I need to consider to determine its profitability?",
            "Mining Verus Coin (VRSC) with Verushash can be a profitable venture, but its profitability depends on several factors. To determine whether mining VRSC is profitable for you, you need to consider the following key factors:\n\n**Hardware:** The type of hardware you use for mining significantly affects your profitability. You can use a CPU, GPU, or FPGA to mine VRSC. If you're using a CPU, it should be a fairly modern one with AES and AVX instructions built-in, which is typically the case for processors produced in 2013 or later. GPUs can also be used, but they may not perform as well as modern CPUs. FPGAs, on the other hand, can be reprogrammed to mine VRSC and may outperform CPUs, but they require a lot of power.\n\n**Energy Price:** Your energy price is another crucial factor to consider. The cost of electricity varies by region, and you need to know your energy price to estimate your mining costs.\n\n**Existing Hardware or New Purchase:** If you already have the necessary hardware, you can use it to mine VRSC. However, if you need to purchase new hardware, you should consider whether the investment is worth it.\n\nTo get an idea of your mining performance, you can refer to the Verushash Hashrates spreadsheet, which provides a list of comparable hardware and their performance. Once you know your hardware's performance and energy price, you can estimate your earnings using a manual calculation.\n\nIn conclusion, mining VRSC with Verushash can be profitable, but it's essential to consider your hardware, energy price, and whether you're using existing hardware or purchasing new equipment. By taking these factors into account, you can make an informed decision about whether mining VRSC is a profitable venture for you.",
            "# Is mining profitable?\n#### Necessary files:\nLink 1: [Verush Hashrates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrSYJDV0Mjj3X-myMC3aQDGkcipivxHsD7ZxJ3r5f_A/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Answer:\nMining VRSC with Verushash is at this time one of the most profitable coins to mine with your CPU.\nIf you want to know how profitable it is, you need to know a few important details about your own conditions.\n1. What hardware will I use to mine with?\n 1. CPU - If that is a fairly modern CPU with AES and AVX instructions built in.\n This will be true if your processor is produced in 2013 or later. For processors between 2008 and 2012 you need to check the specifications.\n Older processors can still mine, but they will not perform well.\n 2. GPU - It is possible to mine with fairly modern Nvidia GPU's, but since Verushash uses specific functions from the\n mentioned AES and AVX instruction sets, they will perform better than old CPUs, but worse than modern CPUs.\n 3. FPGA - Many of these semi-specialized machines can be reprogrammed to mine VRSC. They don't have the same power per processor as a CPU, but they often have multiple processors running parrallel. The stronger ones can outperform a CPU easily, but need a lot of power to do so.\n\n2. What is my energy price?\n\n3. Do I use existing hardware or do I buy?\n\nIf you know the answer to the hardware, you can look op a comparable one in the Spreadsheat from Link 1, to give you an\nidea of the performance.\n\nIf you know your energy price also, you can [calculate](#!faq-allos/faq-allos02_average_time_to_find_a_block_manual_calculation.md) an estimation of how much your hardware can earn you at this moment.\n\nIf you have to get new hardware just to mine, think about it for a moment: would you have bought new hardware anyway? If so,\nyou can use this information to get an idea what kind of hardware you want to buy.\n\nCreated by Oink.vrsc@",
