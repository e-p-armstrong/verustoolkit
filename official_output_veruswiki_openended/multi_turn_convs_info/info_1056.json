            "How do I create a currency on the Verus platform, and what are the benefits of controlling an ID with the same name as the currency I want to create?",
            "To create a currency on the Verus platform, you need to have an ID with the same name as the currency you want to create. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. This means that if you want to create a currency called \"gold\", you need to have an ID called \"gold@\".\n\nHaving an ID with the same name as the currency you want to create gives you control over that currency. You can define the properties of the currency, such as its name, options, and conversion rates, using the `definecurrency` command. For example, if you want to create a currency called \"gold\" that can be converted from VRSCTEST at a rate of 0.01, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines the currency \"gold\" with the specified properties. The `preallocations` field allows you to allocate a certain amount of the currency to a specific ID, in this case \"mike@\".\n\nThe benefits of controlling an ID with the same name as the currency you want to create include:\n\n* **Uniqueness**: Since only the controller of the ID can create a currency of that name, you can be sure that your currency is unique and cannot be duplicated by others.\n* **Control**: As the controller of the ID, you have full control over the currency, including its properties and allocation.\n* **Trust**: By having a trusted and auditable store of value, such as a specific amount of gold, you can create a currency that is widely trusted and valued.\n\nIn the example above, the creator of the \"gold\" currency has control over the currency and can ensure that it is backed by a specific amount of gold, making it a trusted and valuable currency.",
            "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start.
