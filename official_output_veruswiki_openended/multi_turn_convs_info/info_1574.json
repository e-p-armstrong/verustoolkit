            "The Verus network is a powerful and feature-rich blockchain protocol that enables users to interact with PBaaS chains and other blockchain systems in a variety of ways. Some of the key features and capabilities of the Verus network include:\n\n**Merge Mining and Interoperability:** Verus allows users to merge mine PBaaS chains with Verus or other blockchain systems, such as the Ethereum bridge to Goerli. This enables users to connect different blockchain systems and create interoperable, independent blockchains without requiring programming knowledge.\n\n**On-Chain Launches:** Verus enables on-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs. This means that users can create and launch new tokens, currencies, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications directly on the Verus network.\n\n**Self-Sovereign Identities and NFTs:** Verus allows users to create on-chain, self-sovereign identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles. These identities are provable, secure, and decentralized, enabling users to maintain control over their digital identity and assets.\n\n**Resilience and Hardening:** The Verus network is designed to be resilient and hardened against errors and issues. The network's developers continuously update and improve the network to ensure that it can handle complex tasks and interactions without compromising security or functionality.\n\n**Community Engagement and Development:** The Verus network has a strong focus on community engagement and development. The network's developers encourage users to test and contribute to the network's development, and provide resources and support for users to learn and build on the network.\n\nOverall, the Verus network is a powerful tool for users who want to create, interact with, and connect different blockchain systems. Its features and capabilities enable users to build complex, decentralized applications and systems that can interact with a wide range of blockchain networks.",
            "The good news is that since we have the new Verus Notification Oracle technology, we can enable everyone running on the current testnet to remain connected as all cross-chain transactions to and from PBaaS chains will resume flowing. We are still seeing an error in BridgeKeeper, but since this release includes a mainnet security update and addresses all other known issues on testnet, we\u2019ll release this immediately and update Bridgekeeper as soon as possible. In order to merge mine PBaaS chains with Verus or the Ethereum bridge to Goerli going forward, you will need to update to v0.9.9-2, which everyone should run for mainnet anyhow.Once you update, please feel free to resume merge mining all PBaaS chains and Verus. You will need to wait for the BridgeKeeper update to be able to merge mine and stake with Ethereum\u2019s Goerli.Thanks for all your testing! We\u2019ve learned a great deal from this upgrade, and although it may feel like a delay that we took the time to learn and address it in place on the public network before moving on, this learning and consequent hardening will ensure the mainnet release will be more hardened than ever. Next steps are to upgrade auto notarization to be resilient to anything like this level of buildup over weeks automatically and prepare the mainnet release. Join us in testing everything in the #pbaas-development channel. Contribute as you learn and build, and let's all make history together!\n### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
