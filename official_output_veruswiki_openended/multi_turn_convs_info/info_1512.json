            "What kind of guarantees or warranties does the Verus software come with, and what should I be aware of when downloading and installing it on my computer?",
            "The Verus software is provided \"as is\", which means that it does not come with any warranties or guarantees, either express or implied. This includes warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-INFRINGEMENT. In other words, the authors and copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability that may arise from the use or other dealings with the software.\n\nIt's also important to note that some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as a \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software is related to cryptocurrency mining, which may be exploited by third parties to compromise your computer. However, these warnings are false positives, and you can learn more about them by reviewing resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky.\n\nBefore installing Verus, you can also check the software's virus detection status on VirusTotal, a website that analyzes files for malware and other threats. The links provided are for the MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows versions of the software, respectively.\n\nIn summary, while the Verus software does not come with any warranties or guarantees, it is not inherently malicious and is safe to use. However, you should always be cautious when installing new software and take steps to ensure that your computer is secure.",
