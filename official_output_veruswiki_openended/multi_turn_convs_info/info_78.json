            "What are some key features of VerusIDs, and how does VerusHash, specifically VerusHash 2.1, contribute to the Verus ecosystem?",
            "VerusIDs, a fundamental component of the Verus ecosystem, offer several important features that enhance their functionality and security.\n\n**Recoverable**: Each VerusID includes a separate recovery authority, which defaults to the ID itself. This authority can recover the identity by redefining its primary state and recovery state. However, it cannot modify the revocation state or vice versa, unless both are controlled by the same underlying authority.\n\n**Private**: VerusIDs contain a set of zero-knowledge private addresses that can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints. Additionally, each ID has a content map of key-value hashes, which can be used alongside applications and identity policies to provide private yet selectively provable claims and attestations. These claims can be selectively proven components of a strong identity, attested to with a quantum secure signature when available.\n\nNow, let's discuss VerusHash, specifically VerusHash 2.1, and its role in the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**VerusHash 2.1**: VerusHash 2.1 is an adjustment to the equalization technology introduced in VerusHash 2.0, which aimed to equalize the performance of FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) and modern CPUs. VerusHash 2.1 is designed to tilt the balance more favorably towards CPUs while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. This development is significant because it allows for a more balanced and inclusive mining and staking environment.\n\nBy proactively sharing the new algorithm with FPGA manufacturers, Verus developers ensure that everyone has an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy becomes active. This economy will feature identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency but are expected to exceed the potential for block rewards.\n\nIn summary, VerusIDs offer recoverable and private features, while VerusHash 2.1 contributes to a more balanced and inclusive mining and staking environment, ultimately enhancing the overall Verus ecosystem.",
            "- **Recoverable** -- each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to self, and which can recover the identity through redefining its primary state and the recovery state as well, though it cannot modify the revocation state, or vice versa, unless they are both controlled by the same underlying authority.- **Private** - Each ID contains a set of zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial, or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes, intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations to selectively provable components of a strong passport, attested to with a quantum secure signature when that is available.# VerusHash 2.1\nVerusHash 2.0 was the first algorithm to significantly equalize FPGAs dominance over CPUs, once they were introduced on the Verus network. While FPGAs were intentionally not blocked completely, which would simply drive the performance battle to the higher end and further into secret, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was developed to explicitly equalize FPGAs and modern CPUs and has met its original goals in keeping FPGA performance for the price under 2x of CPU. VerusHash 2.1 introduces an adjustment to the equalization technology, which we expect to tilt the balance a bit more favorably towards CPUs, while still enabling FPGAs to operate on the hash algorithm with minor modifications. Verus Developers have proactively reached out to FPGA manufacturers and made the new algorithm available to them, so that everyone will have an opportunity to mine and stake when the Verus economy starts to roll and identity rewards, which will not inflate the currency, but should far exceed the potential for block rewards, begin streaming from the network.# Disclaimer",
