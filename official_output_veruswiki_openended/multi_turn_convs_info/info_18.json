            "How do you define and launch a new token on the Verus network, and what features do these tokens have?",
            "On the Verus network, you can define and launch new tokens using the `definecurrency` and `sendcurrency` APIs. These tokens can be used for various purposes, such as payment models, tickets, point systems, and more. \n\nTo create a new token, you need an ID with the same name as the token. The controller of this ID can control the token and use it for various purposes. \n\nOne of the key features of tokens on the Verus network is that they can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies. This means that tokens can be used to back the value of other currencies, providing a stable store of value. \n\nToken launches can also accept multiple other coins or tokens for conversion to the new token, with payment to the token ID. Each token can have a different conversion price for pre-launch participation, as well as minimums and maximums of participation. If minimums are not met by the currency's start block, all participation will be refunded, less a minimal transfer/network fee.\n\nTokens can be controlled by the blockchain, allowing for decentralized management, or they can be partially blockchain-controlled, centralized tokens, with currencies that are mintable at any time by the ID behind them. The controlling ID can also receive aggregated outgoing transactions to external systems that both burn coins and pass account data in the process. This allows applications to control currency supplies on the public network, whether these applications are external, decentralized networks or centralized custodial systems.\n\nIn many typical use cases of tokens, including club coins, game tokens, token launches, etc., no programming is required. The Verus network provides a flexible and easy-to-use platform for creating and managing tokens, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of applications.",

Mainnet approved testnet release is not yet available## Notable Changes:\n- Check for creation of invalid staking transactions# Verus Testnet PBaaS Multi-currency TokensThe testnet supports a completely new capability of token definitions and token launches (Kickstarter/Gofundme style, ICO, ITO, IPO, etc.). These tokens can be sent through the Verus protocol using the new 'sendcurrency' API, which works for all currencies in the Verus network. Tokens can be used as reserve currencies for other currencies as well. Token launches can accept multiple other coins or tokens for conversion to the new token with payment to the token ID. Each token can have a different conversion price for pre-launch participation as well as minimums and maximums of participation. If minimums are not met by the currency's startblock, all participation will be refunded, less a minimal transfer/network fee, which was already allocated to miners/stakers.Tokens can be controlled by the blockchain and used for many purposes, including payment models, tickets, point systems, etc., or they can be partially blockchain controlled, centralized tokens, with currencies that are mintable at any time by the ID behind them.
