            "What are the main features and improvements in the v1.0.4 update of Verus, and why is it highly recommended to upgrade to this version, especially for mainnet DeFi or cross-chain wallet functions?",
            "The v1.0.4 update of Verus is a critical, non-mandatory mainnet upgrade that brings several key improvements and fixes to the platform. This update is particularly important for mainnet DeFi or cross-chain wallet functions, as it rectifies potential refund failures in edge cases.\n\nOne of the main improvements in this update is the proper insertion of refund addresses in all cases when making DeFi or cross-chain transactions. This ensures that refunds are handled correctly and reduces the risk of errors or losses.\n\nThe update also includes merge mining improvements, which will result in higher performance on all platforms and full pool merge mining support when used in combination with other improvements. This means that users will be able to take advantage of more efficient and effective mining operations.\n\nAdditionally, the CLI (command-line interface) now defaults to mainnet for all PBaaS chains unless the `-testnet` option is specified. This makes it easier for users to work with mainnet and testnet environments.\n\nThere will be two versions of the GUI (graphical user interface) released, one for mainnet and one for testnet. Full PBaaS support in the wallet will only be available for either mainnet or testnet, depending on the version used.\n\nThe update also extends the deprecation height from 20 weeks to 52 weeks, giving users more time to transition to the new version.\n\nTestnet users will also benefit from a separate GUI release and a refund address fix.\n\nOverall, the v1.0.4 update is a significant improvement to the Verus platform, and it is highly recommended to upgrade to this version to take advantage of the new features and fixes. This is especially important for mainnet DeFi or cross-chain wallet functions, as it ensures that users can operate safely and efficiently.",
