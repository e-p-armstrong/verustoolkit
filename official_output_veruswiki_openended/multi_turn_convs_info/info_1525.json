            "What are the benefits of using Verus Vault, and how does it provide decentralized protection and recovery of funds, IDs, and NFTs?",
            "Verus Vault offers a decentralized solution to protect and recover funds, IDs, and NFTs from common forms of crypto loss or theft. This is achieved through the use of locked VerusIDs, which can be revoked and recovered by their revocation and recovery authority identities in case of an unauthorized unlock. \n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Locked VerusIDs**: A VerusID can be locked, which means that anyone with only the primary keys (even a multisig of primary keys) must first unlock and then wait for a predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds.\n\n2. **Revocation and Recovery**: The revocation and recovery authority identities can circumvent the lock and recover the funds, IDs, or NFTs in case of an unauthorized unlock. This provides an additional layer of security and decentralized funds recovery.\n\n3. **Decentralized Solution to the 5 Dollar Wrench Attack**: By setting a delay on the unlock time, Verus Vault provides a decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack, where an attacker tries to force a user to reveal their private keys.\n\n4. **Protection and Recovery of IDs and NFTs**: Verus Vault not only protects and recovers funds but also provides the same security for IDs and NFTs.\n\n5. **Time Locks for Other Purposes**: Verus Vault also allows for time locks to be used for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.\n\nIn summary, Verus Vault offers a decentralized solution to protect and recover funds, IDs, and NFTs from common forms of crypto loss or theft, providing a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery.",
            "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",
