            "What are the notable changes and precautions to consider when using the Verus software, and how can I access the software for different operating systems?",
            "The Verus software is an experimental and unfinished product, and users should be aware of the risks involved when using it. Despite this, the software has undergone some notable changes, including the renaming of komodod and komodo-cli to verusd and verus, and the removal of wrappers. Additionally, there have been some minor staking improvements, fixes to longest chain reporting and getchaintips bugs, and preparations for PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) technology.\n\nBefore using the software, it's essential to understand that it's provided \"as is\" and without any warranty. Users are cautioned to use the software at their own risk, as it may cause damage to their systems or data.\n\nTo access the software, users can download it from the provided links for different operating systems:\n\n* MacOS: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/4de5aa22de6d43554f3456abe690c4ca1405e3326748dda14710d85f66634919/detection\n* Linux: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/4f5bc9cc22046b675fea304155026cc2c951ad4760ee5a2e27b42b5db8e4765d/detection\n* Windows: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/787d46b30681e86c20d1875ab3c18c3253168a680c801c64de7a9f43b8b2db2c/detection\n\nPlease note that some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software is related to mining, which can be installed by third parties to exploit users' PCs. For more information on these false positives, users can refer to the provided resources.\n\nIt's also important to note that this release does not support the PBaaS testnet. To participate in the PBaaS testnet, users should use the PBaaS Cross-chain Technology Preview, which can be found on the VerusCoin GitHub page.",
