            "What are Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault, and how do they contribute to the sustainability and security of the Verus ecosystem?",
            "Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault are two innovative solutions developed by the Verus team to address specific challenges in the blockchain space.\n\n**Verus Fee Pooling Technology:**\nVerus Fee Pooling technology is a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model that aims to strengthen the security of the blockchain while providing a fair and incentive-based system for miners and stakers. In this model, all fees from transactions in a block are gathered and added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees. The current block miner or staker then takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool. This approach preserves the immediate incentive for miners and stakers to maximize per-block fees while smoothing fee distribution over time. This solution addresses concerns raised by Vitalik Buterin regarding the potential risks of weakening blockchain security due to fee structures.\n\n**Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities:**\nVerus Vault is a feature introduced on the Verus testnet that enables advanced time locking of identities, providing a theft-resistant workflow for identity management. This technology allows for various use cases, including trusts, vesting schedules, escrow alternatives, estate planning, and more. By combining Verus Vault with the revocation and recovery capabilities of VerusID, the possibilities for secure and flexible identity management are greatly expanded. The concept of Verus Vault is simple yet powerful, enabling users to create complex workflows for managing their identities and assets.\n\nIn summary, Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault are two innovative solutions that contribute to the sustainability and security of the Verus ecosystem. They provide a fair and incentive-based system for miners and stakers, while enabling advanced identity management capabilities that can be used in a variety of applications.",
            "- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
