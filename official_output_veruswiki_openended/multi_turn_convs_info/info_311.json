            "How do Verus identities work in terms of control, transfer, and management of funds and transactions?",
            "Verus identities are designed to provide a high level of control and flexibility in managing funds and transactions. Here's how they work:\n\n**Control and Signatures:** Each identity consists of a set of addresses (one or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of the identity. This ensures that only authorized parties can access and manage the funds and transactions associated with the identity.\n\n**Authority Structure:** Each identity has three types of authorities: Primary, Revocation, and Recovery.\n\n1. **Primary Authority:** This is the self-identity and has the ability to modify any part of the identity except its name, parent, and data under the control of the other two authorities.\n2. **Revocation Authority:** This identity can revoke the primary identity, which will revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control. However, it cannot spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n3. **Recovery Authority:** This authority can redefine or recover a revoked identity, but it cannot change the revocation authority nor modify an unrevoked identity.\n\n**Transferability:** Identities can be transferred by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party's control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so.\n\n**Fund Management:** If an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity using `z_getbalance identity@`.\n\n**Future-Proofing:** If new address types or signature algorithms are added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be compatible with the new technology. This ensures that Verus identities are future-proof and can adapt to new developments in blockchain technology.",

Each identity also refers to two additional identities that have authority over:\n  - **Primary** - this is the self identity and may modify any part of the identity except its name, its parent, which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined, and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.\n  - **Revocation** - this identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n  - **Recovery** - this authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all.\n3. Identities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party\u2019s control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so.\n4. If an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity using `z_getbalance identity@\u201d`.\n5. If later, a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure s added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be ",
