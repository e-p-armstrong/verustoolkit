            "What is the `definecurrency` command and how does it work? Additionally, what is the `estimateconversion` command and how does it estimate conversions between currencies?",
            "The `definecurrency` command is used to define a new currency on the Verus network. This command can be used in two ways: through the Verus command line interface or through an HTTP request using the `curl` command.\n\n**Defining a Currency through the Command Line Interface:**\nTo define a currency using the Verus command line interface, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus definecurrency jsondefinition\n```\nHere, `jsondefinition` is a JSON object that defines the properties of the new currency.\n\n**Defining a Currency through an HTTP Request:**\nAlternatively, you can define a currency by sending an HTTP request to the Verus server. The request should be sent to `http://127.0.0.1:27486/` and should include the JSON definition of the currency. Here's an example of how to do this using the `curl` command:\n```\ncurl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"definecurrency\", \"params\": [jsondefinition] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nThe `estimateconversion` command, on the other hand, is used to estimate the conversion of one currency to another. This command takes into account pending conversions, fees, and slippage.\n\n**Estimating Conversions:**\nTo estimate a conversion, you can use the following command:\n```\nestimateconversion '{\"currency\":\"name\",\"convertto\":\"name\",\"amount\":n}'\n```\nHere, `name` is the name of the source currency, `convertto` is the name of the destination currency, and `n` is the amount of the source currency to convert.\n\nThe `estimateconversion` command also has several optional arguments:\n\n* `preconvert`: This is a boolean value that specifies whether to convert to the destination currency at market price. This option only works if the transaction is mined before the start of the currency.\n* `via`: This is the name of a common fractional currency to convert through if the source and destination currencies are reserves.\n\nBy using these commands, you can define new currencies and estimate conversions between them on the Verus network.",
            "Examples:\n```bash\n> verus definecurrency jsondefinition\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"definecurrency\", \"params\": [jsondefinition] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```### `estimateconversion '{\"currency\":\"name\",\"convertto\":\"name\",\"amount\":n}'`\nThis estimates conversion from one currency to another, taking into account pending conversions, fees and slippage.#### Arguments\n```json\n{\n \"currency\": \"name\"    (string, required) Name of the source currency to send in this output, defaults to\n                        native of chain\n \"amount\":amount     (numeric, required) The numeric amount of currency, denominated in source currency\n \"convertto\":\"name\",   (string, optional) Valid currency to convert to, either a reserve of a fractional, or fractional\n \"preconvert\":\"false\",  (bool, optional)  Convert to currency at market price (default=false), only works if\n                        transaction is mined before start of currency\n \"via\":\"name\",      (string, optional) If source and destination currency are reserves, via is a common fractional\n                        to convert through\n}\n```",
