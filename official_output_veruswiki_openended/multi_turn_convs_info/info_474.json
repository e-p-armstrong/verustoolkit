            "How does Verus enable the launch of new blockchains and blockchain-based crowdfunding currencies, and what features are available for launching and managing these new currencies?",
            "Verus provides a platform for launching new blockchains and blockchain-based crowdfunding currencies, offering a range of features to facilitate successful launches and management of these new currencies.\n\n**Simultaneous Blockchain and Liquidity Pool Launches:**\nVerus allows for the simultaneous launch of a new blockchain and a decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This bridge converter liquidity pool enables the seamless conversion of currencies between different blockchains, with all fees generated by cross-chain conversions or general use of the liquidity pool being earned on the new blockchain. This means that there is no rent paid back to the Verus blockchain, and the new blockchain maintains full control over its fees.\n\n**Blockchain-Based Crowdfunding Currency Launches:**\nVerus provides a crowdfunding mechanism for launching new currencies, allowing users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on the chain. If these minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees. Additionally, launch options can include maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs.\n\n**Interoperable Multichain Network:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, allowing for unlimited scale and new use cases. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains to be available for merge mining and staking. This facilitates the creation of a global network of interconnected blockchains, each with its own unique features and use cases.\n\nIn summary, Verus provides a robust platform for launching and managing new blockchains and blockchain-based currencies, offering features such as simultaneous blockchain and liquidity pool launches, blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches, and an interoperable multichain network for unlimited scale and new use cases.",
            "# Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches\n - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)\n- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as",
