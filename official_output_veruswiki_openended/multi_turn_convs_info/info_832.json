            "Please explain how to use Linux bash scripts to make managing a Linux-based CLI miner easier, including monitoring the miner service, alerting on new blocks mined, and backing up the wallet to a secured email?",
            "To make managing your Linux-based CLI miner easier, you can use several bash scripts. These scripts can help you monitor the miner service, alert you when new blocks are mined, and back up your wallet to a secured email.\n\n**Script 1: MINER SRVC MONITOR & ALERT IF DOWN**\nThis script checks if the Verus daemon (`verusd`) is running. If it's not running, it sends an email to alert you that the miner has stopped. To use this script, you need to install `mailutils` (Postfix) and configure it with your server's FQDN and set `inet_interfaces=localhost` in the Postfix `main.cf` file.\n\nHere's how the script works:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nif pgrep -x \"verusd\" > /dev/null\nthen\n  TRUE=\"1\"\nelse\n  echo \"Merry Miner Has Stopped Mining!!! HELP!!\" | mail -s \"OUTAGE: Merry\" -a \"From: user@yourqualifieddomain.tld\" you@youremail.tld\nfi\n```\n**Script 2: ALERT ON NEW BLOCKS MINED**\nThis script checks for new blocks mined by comparing the current wallet TX count with the count stored in a file called `txHistory.txt`. If the count has changed, it updates the file and sends an email to alert you. To use this script, you need to create a file called `txHistory.txt` with a value of 0 in it, saved to your home folder.\n\nHere's how the script works:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nhistoricalcount=$(cat /home/user/txHistory.txt)\nlivecount=$(/home/user/verus-cli/verus getwalletinfo | grep txcount | sed '/[^0-9]*//g')\nif (($livecount > $historicalcount))\nthen\n  echo $livecount > /home/user/txHistory.txt\n  echo \"Merry Miner Has Mined a Total of $livecount Blocks! Woot!\" | mail -s \"Merry's Blocks: $livecount\" -a \"From: user@yourqualifieddomain.tld\" you@youremail.tld\nelse\n  NOCHANGE=\"1\"\nfi\n```\n**Script 3: WALLET BACKUP TO SECURED EMAIL**\nThis script backs up your wallet to a secured email, such as Protonmail. It's recommended to set up a new Protonmail account with no association to any other service or your name, and secure it with 2FA. You can schedule this script in your CRONTAB to run regularly.\n\nNote: The Verus wallet and data location on Linux is `~/.komodo/VRSC`. For wallet versions prior to 0.5.7, you need to replace `verusd` with `komodod`.",
            "# Linux Bash Scripts To Make Mining Life Easier.\nFollowing are some bash scriptse to help make managing your Linux-based CLI miner a bit easier. Prereq is to install mailutils (postfix) and configure with your server's FQDN and set inet_interfaces=localhost in the postfix/main.cf file.### Important General Information\n`VRSC Wallet & data location` on Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC`\nfor wallet version prior to 0.5.7, replace verusd with komodod.## Scripts:#### MINER SRVC MONITOR & ALERT IF DOWNChecks for the verusd daemon and if it has stopped emails you.##### checkifverusdisrunning.sh```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nif pgrep -x \"verusd\" > /dev/null\nthen\n  TRUE=\"1\"\nelse\n  echo \"Merry Miner Has Stopped Mining!!! HELP!!\" | mail -s \"OUTAGE: Merry\" -a \"From: user@yourqualifieddomain.tld\" you@youremail.tld\nfi\n```#### ALERT ON NEW BLOCKS MINEDPrereq: Create a file called txHistory.txt and put 0 in it, saved to your home folder.\nThe script then compares the current wallet TX count and compares to the txHistory file...\nso first run it will enter the right number in that file overwriting your 0.\nOnly emails you if the number changes.##### checkfornewblocks.sh```bash\n#!/bin/bashhistoricalcount=$(cat /home/user/txHistory.txt)\nlivecount=$(/home/user/verus-cli/verus getwalletinfo | grep txcount | sed 's/[^0-9]*//g')if (($livecount > $historicalcount))\nthen\n  echo $livecount > /home/user/txHistory.txt\n  echo \"Merry Miner Has Mined a Total of $livecount Blocks! Woot!\" | mail -s \"Merry's Blocks: $livecount\" -a \"From: user@yourqualifieddomain.tld\" you@youremail.tld\nelse\n NOCHANGE=\"1\"\nfi\n```#### WALLET BACKUP TO SECURED EMAIL (PROTONMAIL SUGGESTED)For this script I recommend setting up a new Protonmail account with no association to any other service or your name, 2FA secure it.#### Schedule script in CRONTAB",
