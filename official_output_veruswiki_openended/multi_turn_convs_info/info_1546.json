            "What are the different options available when defining a currency in Verus, and what do they do?",
            "When defining a currency in Verus, there are several options available that allow for customization and configuration of the currency's behavior. These options are represented as integer values that can be combined to achieve specific results.\n\nHere's a breakdown of each option and what it does:\n\n* `OPTION_FRACTIONAL` (1): Allows for reserve conversion using base calculations when set. This means that the currency can be divided into smaller units for transactions.\n* `OPTION_ID_ISSUANCE` (2): If set, IDs may only be created by the controlling ID, making it permission-based. Otherwise, ID creation is permissionless.\n* `OPTION_ID_STAKING` (4): Enables equal staking for all IDs on the chain, rather than value-based staking.\n* `OPTION_ID_REFERRALS` (8): If set, this chain supports referrals, allowing for incentivized ID creation.\n* `OPTION_ID_REFERRALREQUIRED` (16): If set, this chain requires referrals for ID creation.\n* `OPTION_TOKEN` (32): Indicates that this is a token, not a native currency.\n* `OPTION_SINGLECURRENCY` (64): Restricts the chain to a single currency, typically used for PBaaS chains or gateways.\n* `OPTION_GATEWAY` (128): Routes external currencies, making it a gateway currency.\n* `OPTION_PBAAS` (256): Indicates that this is a PBaaS chain definition.\n* `OPTION_GATEWAY_CONVERTER` (512): Makes this the default converter for a specific PBaaS gateway, publishing prices.\n* `OPTION_GATEWAY_NAMECONTROLLER` (1024): When not set on a gateway, top-level ID and currency registration happen on the launch chain.\n* `OPTION_NFT_TOKEN` (2048): Creates a single satoshi NFT token, tokenizing control over the root ID.\n\nThese options can be combined using bitwise operations to achieve specific configurations for a currency. For example, setting `OPTION_FRACTIONAL` and `OPTION_TOKEN` would allow for fractional reserve conversions and indicate that the currency is a token.",
