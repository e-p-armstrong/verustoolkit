            "What are the benefits and capabilities of VerusIDs, decentralized tokens, and PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network?",
            "VerusIDs offer several benefits and capabilities to users. They can be used as friendly names for cryptocurrency addresses on all Verus PBaaS blockchains, and the VerusID protocol can be implemented on non-Verus systems. \n\n**Revoking and Recovering IDs:**\nVerusIDs can be revoked and recovered, allowing users to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID. This enables a virtually theft-proof workflow and provides a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the $5 wrench attack, and identity theft.\n\n**Decentralized Tokens and Blockchains:**\nAny user with a VerusID can create their own token currency or even a full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain. These PBaaS chains are 50% POW/50% POS and 51% hash attack resistant, and they can be merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network. \n\n**DeFi Capabilities:**\nVerusIDs also enable users to define DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions using a particular liquidity pool and mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner-extracted value (MEV) and front-running. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n\nOverall, VerusIDs, decentralized tokens, and PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network offer a wide range of benefits and capabilities, including theft-proof workflows, decentralized token creation, and DeFi capabilities.",

All PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n## Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets\n- Any ID owner may define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing.
