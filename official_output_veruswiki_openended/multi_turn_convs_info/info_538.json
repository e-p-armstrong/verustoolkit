            "How do I rescan my Verus wallet, and what are some important notes about staking and mining in Verus?",
            "To rescan your Verus wallet, you can follow these steps:\n\n**For Command Line Interface (CLI) Users:**\nYou can simply add the parameter `-rescan` when starting the daemon.\n\n**For Graphical User Interface (GUI) Users:**\nTo rescan your wallet in the GUI, follow these steps:\n1. Close the Verus application and wait for it to fully close.\n2. Restart the GUI.\n3. When restarting, select \"Activate Coin\" (not a dropdown shortcut).\n4. On the \"Activate Coin\" screen, select \"Verus\" and then select \"Native mode\".\n5. Choose the \"daemon param: rescan\" option.\n6. Click \"Activate Coin\".\n\nNow, about staking and mining in Verus: \n**Important Notes:**\n- Staking is now off by default to prevent multi-machine staking of the same coins or addresses. This means that if you have two machines staking blocks with the same coins, each on a separate fork, you can lose your block reward to a cheat-catcher.\n- To enable staking, you can use the `-mint` parameter with `verusd`, `setgenerate true 0` with the `verus` CLI, or the staking button in the GUI.\n- **Only stake any address or wallet on one computer at a time**, unless you can be absolutely sure they are in sync and on the same chain at every block.\n- You can still mine on as many machines as you'd like, but be careful with staking.\n\nThese notes are crucial to avoid losing your block rewards and to ensure the security and integrity of your Verus wallet.",
