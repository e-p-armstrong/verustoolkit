            "What is the Verus project and what are its core principles, and how does it enable the creation of new blockchains?",
            "The Verus project is an open-source, fair launched, decentralized blockchain protocol that aims to provide a genuine and community-driven platform for creating and operating blockchains. Verus is designed to be efficient, secure, and accessible to everyone, with a focus on empowering the community to contribute and participate in the development of the project.\n\nAt its core, Verus is not just a single blockchain, but an entire ecosystem of interconnected blockchains that operate decentralized and at the protocol level. This means that Verus enables the creation of multiple blockchains that can interact and interoperate with each other, creating a robust and diverse ecosystem.\n\nOne of the key features of Verus is its Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) platform, which allows anyone to create their own full-fledged cryptocurrency, as long as it can be funded or supported by miners. This means that newly created chains are just as secure as Verus itself and have the ability to be merge mined, making it possible to create multiple chains that can be secured and maintained simultaneously.\n\nThe Verus project is committed to being community-driven and has established a foundation that is run by and for community members. The foundation regularly pays out bounties to community members who contribute to the development of the project, ensuring that the community is actively involved in shaping the direction of Verus.\n\nOverall, Verus is designed to be a decentralized, community-driven, and efficient platform for creating and operating blockchains, with a focus on empowering individuals and organizations to create their own cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based systems.",
            "We believe that actions speak louder than words. Anything that may be considered hype can be backed up with functional examples. What we\u2019re doing here is genuine. We are trying to be the real deal, **just as Bitcoin started out, as an open-source, fair launched, no ICO, or pre-mined, or even dev funded project.** Despite this, a foundation has been established by and for fellow community members. There is always more to be done and the foundation regularly pays out bounties to community members that help to make the Verus vision a reality. In fact, just about everything has been designed to reinforce the community. Designed with efficiency in mind, only the miners and stakers are rewarded for securing the chains. This ensures bare minimum costs to the end user starting up a chain and the sleek UI removes the technical barrier.## NEW TO VERUS?### What we\u2019re about:Put simply, Verus is much more than any single ordinary blockchain; more of an entire ecosystem of **interconnected blockchains that all operate decentralized and at the protocol level**. Verus introduces Verus PBaaS (__**Public Blockchains as a Service**__), a true publicly notarized blockchain as a service with an easy to use built in wallet UI, designed to make it so that now anyone can start their very own full-fledged cryptocurrency so long as it can be funded or supported by miners. Newly created chains are just as secure as Verus itself and have the ability to be merge mined (up to __22x__ at once\\!)",
