            "How do I verify the authenticity of a Verus download, and what are the notable changes in this release?",
            "Verifying the authenticity of a Verus download is a crucial step to ensure the integrity of the software. To do this, you can use the `verus` command-line tool to verify the signature of the downloaded archive.\n\nHere are the steps to verify the download:\n\n1. **Extract the downloaded archive**: First, extract the downloaded archive to a temporary location.\n2. **Verify the signature**: Use the `verifyfile` command to verify the signature of the extracted archive. The command takes three arguments: the identity of the signer (`Verus Coin Foundation Releases@`), the signature, and the path to the extracted archive.\n\nExample:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" Afn5DwABQSBdcb9HEXsztsaPQLtxhwA1U31x7ahYamF+DqxIn3j+pk/WQEv79ewYd5pDgjp5AJ/cpKWIfCVi468j1PbZ5WeJ /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.0-amd64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.0-amd64.tar.gz\n```\nAlternatively, you can verify the signature using the `verifyhash` command, which takes the identity of the signer, the signature, and the SHA256 checksum of the archive as arguments.\n\nExample:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" Afn5DwABQSBdcb9HEXsztsaPQLtxhwA1U31x7ahYamF+DqxIn3j+pk/WQEv79ewYd5pDgjp5AJ/cpKWIfCVi468j1PbZ5WeJ f769349015e0f4b8a6da9b071e3342f2043bd6eec35a69a97de7c7b4fd910148\n```\nIf the signature is valid, the command will output `true`.\n\n**Notable Changes in this Release:**\nThis release includes several notable changes:\n\n1. **Added `getsaplingtree` API**: This release adds a new API for working with Sapling trees.\n2. **Added support for Verus Testnet with PBaaS Multi-currency Tokens**: This release adds support for the Verus Testnet, which includes PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) multi-currency tokens.\n3. **Resolved multi-block reorg issue on mainnet**: This release resolves an issue that could cause multi-block reorgs on the mainnet.\n\n**Testnet Reset:**\nIf you have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to this release, you will need to delete the following directories before running this new update:\n\n* **Linux:** `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest`\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure the authenticity of your Verus download and take advantage of the new features and improvements in this release.",
            "## Verifying Downloads\nA txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, is included for each download. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\".\n1) Extract downloaded archive\n2) Verify signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3) Extract archive to desired directory\n### CLI examples\n**Verifying file directly**\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" Afn5DwABQSBdcb9HEXsztsaPQLtxhwA1U31x7ahYamF+DqxIn3j+pk/WQEv79ewYd5pDgjp5AJ/cpKWIfCVi468j1PbZ5WeJ /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.0-amd64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.0-amd64.tar.gz\n```\n**Verifying using a checksum**\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" Afn5DwABQSBdcb9HEXsztsaPQLtxhwA1U31x7ahYamF+DqxIn3j+pk/WQEv79ewYd5pDgjp5AJ/cpKWIfCVi468j1PbZ5WeJ f769349015e0f4b8a6da9b071e3342f2043bd6eec35a69a97de7c7b4fd910148\n```**The result will be true if the signature is valid.**\n```\ntrue\n```This is a mainnet release with fix to prevent any recurrence of the recent minor fork at block 1002417 and integrated support for the new PBaaS testnet. This release is approved for use on mainnet nodes, and it is being released on Github prior to full GUI wallet release v0.6.5-2 to enable exchanges, pools, and infrastructure nodes to update immediately, as needed.## Notable Changes:\n- Added `getsaplingtree` API\n- Added support for Verus Testnet with PBaaS Multi-currency Tokens\n- Resolved multi-block reorg issue on mainnet that can prevent successful reorg in rare, otherwise valid cases## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on this release. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/VRSCTEST\n~/.verustest\n```",
