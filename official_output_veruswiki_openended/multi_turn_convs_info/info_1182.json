            "What are the Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault, and how do they contribute to the security and functionality of the Verus blockchain ecosystem?",
            "The Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault are two innovative features of the Verus blockchain ecosystem that aim to enhance the security, sustainability, and functionality of the network.\n\n**Verus Fee Pooling Technology:**\nVerus Fee Pooling technology is a sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model that addresses the concerns of blockchain security and fee distribution. In this model, all fees from transactions in a block are gathered and added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees. The current block miner or staker then takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool. This approach preserves the immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time. This solution ensures that the blockchain security is strengthened, rather than weakened, by providing a sustainable revenue model for miners and stakers.\n\n**Verus Vault:**\nVerus Vault is an advanced time-locking feature for identities that provides a theft-resistant workflow of identity management. It enables various use cases, such as trusts, vesting schedules, escrow alternatives, estate planning, and more. The concept is simple yet powerful, and when combined with the revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID, the ramifications are immense. Verus Vault allows for advanced control and management of identities, providing an additional layer of security and flexibility to the Verus ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, the Verus Fee Pooling technology and Verus Vault are two groundbreaking features that enhance the security, sustainability, and functionality of the Verus blockchain ecosystem. They provide a sustainable revenue model for miners and stakers, while also offering advanced identity management capabilities that enable various use cases and enhance the overall security of the network.",
            "- **Verus Fee Pooling technology** A sustainable mining and staking fee and revenue model while strengthening, rather than creating risk of weakening blockchain security, by preserving immediate incentive to maximize per-block fees, while smoothing fee distribution to miners and stakers over time, fully addressing the legitimate concerns expressed and still not addressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/). In the fee pooling model, which is an extremely powerful, yet simple solution to enabling a mining and staking economy, all fees are gathered from transactions in a block as usual, then the fees, also calculated as usual, are added to a common, persistent pool of collected fees, and the current block miner or staker takes up to 1% of the aggregate fee pool.### Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities\nOn the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we cal Verus Vault, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.",
