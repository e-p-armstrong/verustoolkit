            "What are the capabilities and limitations of different types of VerusIDs, including Native IDs and those issued by fractional or centralized currencies, and how do they relate to launching currencies, revocation, and recovery?",
            "In the Verus ecosystem, there are different types of IDs, each with its own capabilities and limitations.\n\n**Native IDs:** These are IDs registered directly from a blockchain, making them the \"parent\" of their respective blockchain. Native IDs have the ability to launch currencies on their native blockchain, and if they are on the Verus blockchain, they can even launch independent blockchains.\n\n**IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies:** These IDs, on the other hand, cannot launch currencies. However, they are still valuable for other purposes, such as:\n\n* Revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs\n* Personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with identity and NFT features\n* Proofs, brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login\n* Cross-proving common ownership with other IDs\n\n**Exception: *.veth gateway IDs:** These IDs are decentralized and can be registered from the Ethereum bridge converter. They have the ability to create Ethereum-mapped currencies. The registration fee for.veth IDs is set to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees (except for the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool) going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.\n\nIn summary, Native IDs have more capabilities, including launching currencies and blockchains, while IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies have more limited capabilities, but are still valuable for other use cases. The exception is *.veth gateway IDs, which can create Ethereum-mapped currencies.",
            "While Native IDs, those registered directly from a blockchain as the name parent, will be able to launch currencies on that blockchain, and if on Verus, actual independent blockchains, IDs issued by fractional or centralized currencies cannot launch currencies, but will still be valuable as revocation and recovery IDs for all other VerusIDs as well as for personalized on-chain and cross-chain addresses with all identity and NFT features, for proofs, for brands, contract binding, on-chain marketplace trading, or login, and will have the ability to cross-prove common ownership with other IDs as well.The exception to non-native IDs creating currencies, is that *.veth gateway IDs will be available for decentralized registration from the Ethereum bridge converter and will be able to create Ethereum mapped currencies. Registration of .veth IDs will be priced at a level to prevent misuse and support bridge liquidity, with all fees besides the 1 VRSC import fee, which goes into the mining and staking fee pool going to the bridge converter liquidity basket.All of these features are currently enabled on the v0.9.2 new testnet. Stay connected on the #pbaas-development channel and participate in the launch at no actual cost as a testnet liquidity provider and get some nice testnet IDs, launch your own currencies, or start your exclusive ID-restricted club, governance group, or business.## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):",
