            "What are the key features of Verus Coin wallet version 0.4.0 and later, and how do they contribute to the security and performance of the Verus Coin network?",
            "The Verus Coin wallet version 0.4.0 and later have several key features that enhance the security and performance of the Verus Coin network. One of the most significant features is the support for Sapling high-performance zero-knowledge transactions. This technology enables fast and secure transactions on the Verus Coin network, which is essential for its overall performance.\n\nIn addition to basic Sapling support, version 0.4.0c of the wallet also includes support for Sapling-compatible, transparent mobile transactions. This feature allows for seamless and secure transactions on mobile devices, making it easier for users to interact with the Verus Coin network on-the-go.\n\nAnother important feature of version 0.4.0 and later is the support for Stake Guard transactions. This feature helps to ensure the security of the network by preventing selfish staking behavior, which can compromise the integrity of the blockchain.\n\nFurthermore, version 0.4.0c of the wallet includes a powerful \"Cheat Catcher\" feature. This feature enables miners and stakers to earn money by catching and preventing selfish staking behavior on the network. The \"Cheat Catcher\" requires a Sapling z-address, which can be added to the CLI wallet using the \"-cheatcatcher=zaddress\" option or in the Settings->App config of the enhanced Agama GUI.\n\nOverall, the features of Verus Coin wallet version 0.4.0 and later contribute to the security and performance of the Verus Coin network by enabling fast and secure transactions, preventing selfish staking behavior, and incentivizing miners and stakers to maintain the integrity of the blockchain.",
            "- All versions of the Verus Coin wallet from **0.4.0** and later have support for **Sapling high performance zero knowledge transactions**, which will activate on the Verus Coin Network at block **227520**. In addition to basic Sapling support, 0.4.0c includes support for Sapling compatible, transparent mobile transactions. **For lite mode usage on the Verus Coin or Zcash networks, you will need Verus Enhanced Agama v 0.4.0c.**- In addition to Sapling and support for Stake Guard transactions, which all versions **0.4.0** or later have, 0.4.0c also includes a powerful *\u201cCheat Catcher\u201d* that can earn money as miners and stakers who use it protect the Verus Coin network by catching stakers who are staking for rewards in a selfish way that does not contribute to converging the network on one blockchain. **The new \u201cCheat Catcher\u201d support requires a Sapling z-address, either passed in to the CLI wallet with the \u201c-cheatcatcher=zaddress\u201d option, or added in the Settings->App config of the enhanced Agama GUI.**",
