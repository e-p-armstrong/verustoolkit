            "How does Verus track the status of network upgrades and consensus rules, and what information is provided about each upgrade and consensus rule?",
            "Verus tracks the status of network upgrades and consensus rules through several objects in its data structure. Here's a breakdown of what each object provides:\n\n**\"softforks\" object:** This object contains information about the progress of softforks, which are upgrades to the network that are backwards compatible. It has three sub-objects: \"enforce\", \"reject\", and \"upgrades\".\n\n**\"enforce\" sub-object:** This sub-object provides information about the enforcement of new-version blocks. It has four fields:\n\n* \"status\": a boolean indicating whether the threshold for enforcing the new version has been reached.\n* \"found\": the number of blocks with the new version that have been found.\n* \"required\": the number of blocks required to trigger the enforcement of the new version.\n* \"window\": the maximum size of the examined window of recent blocks.\n\n**\"reject\" sub-object:** This sub-object is similar to \"enforce\", but it tracks the progress toward rejecting pre-softfork blocks.\n\n**\"upgrades\" object:** This object contains information about the status of network upgrades. Each upgrade is represented by a sub-object with the following fields:\n\n* \"name\": the name of the upgrade.\n* \"activationheight\": the block height at which the upgrade will be activated.\n* \"status\": the current status of the upgrade.\n* \"info\": additional information about the upgrade.\n\n**\"consensus\" object:** This object contains information about the current and upcoming consensus rules. It has two fields:\n\n* \"chaintip\": the branch ID used to validate the current chain tip.\n* \"nextblock\": the branch ID that the next block will be validated under.\n\nIn summary, Verus provides detailed information about the status of network upgrades and consensus rules, including the progress of softforks, the status of each upgrade, and the current and upcoming consensus rules. This information helps users and developers understand the current state of the network and make informed decisions about their interactions with it.",
