            "What kind of warranty and liability does the Verus software come with, and what should I know about potential antivirus warnings when installing it?",
            "The Verus software is provided \"as is\", which means that it does not come with any warranty, express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Additionally, the authors and copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\nRegarding antivirus warnings, some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because Verus is a mining software, and some antivirus software may alert users about the potential risks of installing mining software, which could be exploited by third parties to use a user's computer for malicious purposes.\n\nIt's essential to understand that these warnings are false positives, and Verus is a legitimate software. If you're concerned about these warnings, you can review resources from reputable cybersecurity companies, such as Malwarebytes and Kaspersky, which provide more information about these false positives and how to handle them.\n\nTo verify the safety of the Verus software, you can check the virus detection results on VirusTotal, a reputable online platform that analyzes files for malware and viruses.
