            "How can Verus Vault be used for time-locking and what are some potential use cases, and how can you use the `updateidentity` command to set time locks and delays on an identity?",
            "Verus Vault is a powerful protocol capability that allows for time-locking, which can be used in various ways beyond just theft resistance and delayed lock opening. One of the key uses of Verus Vault is to provide standard forms of time-locking, where funds can be locked for a specific period of time and then automatically unlocked. This can be achieved by setting a time lock and unlock period in one operation, allowing the unlock period to start counting down immediately.\n\nSome potential use cases for this technology include:\n\n* Providing time-locked funds to team members, children, or employees\n* Structuring deal and payment terms with time-locked payments\n* Creating structured savings plans or investments with time-locked withdrawals\n\nThe `updateidentity` command can be used to set time locks and delays on an identity. There are two ways to use this command:\n\n* **Time Lock:** By setting the `timelock` parameter to a specific block height, you can define the unlock height of the identity. This means that the identity will be locked until the specified block height is reached, at which point it will be automatically unlocked.\n* **Time Delay:** By setting the `timelock` parameter to a specific block delay, you can define how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. This allows for a delay between when the unlock is triggered and when the identity is actually unlocked.\n\nIt's important to note that revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height. Additionally, a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `updateidentity` command to set a time lock:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nAnd here's an example of how to use the `updateidentity` command to set a time delay:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```",
            "In addition to use cases related to theft resistance and delayed lock opening, Verus Vault can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms. The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.- **Time Lock:**\n  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- **Time Delay:**\n  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n  ```\n  Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.### Sending and Converting Currency\n**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**",
