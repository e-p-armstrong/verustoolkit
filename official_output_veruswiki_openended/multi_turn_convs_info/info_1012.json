            "How can I verify the authenticity of a Verus download to ensure it has not been tampered with, and what are the recommended steps to take after verifying the download?",
            "To verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you need to follow a few steps. The Verus Coin Foundation Releases@ identity signs each download with a digital signature, which is included in a `.txt` file along with the download. This file contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature.\n\nHere are the recommended steps to verify the download:\n\n1. **Extract the downloaded archive**: First, extract the downloaded archive to a folder on your computer.\n2. **Verify the signature**: Use the `verifyfile` command in the Verus CLI to verify the signature of the extracted archive. The command takes three arguments: the identity of the signer (`Verus Coin Foundation Releases@`), the signature, and the path to the extracted archive.\n\nFor example:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"ASKRIgABQR8y/Iv9s1rJfeLS8Kdq4SxnKKFtTFXjJ/Di7QKwiejX/0WRyEl9UWUa0W4+zKiyW7fMGcGZjPm62lrpPLs8sG/P\" \"/Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.4-3-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.4-3-x86_64.tar.gz\"\n```\nAlternatively, you can verify the download using a checksum. Use the `verifyhash` command, which takes three arguments: the identity of the signer, the signature, and the checksum.\n\nFor example:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"ASKRIgABQR8y/Iv9s1rJfeLS8Kdq4SxnKKFtTFXjJ/Di7QKwiejX/0WRyEl9UWUa0W4+zKiyW7fMGcGZjPm62lrpPLs8sG/P\" 092e4fbc470530a7943fe080c27d9470483ea7947400d6da599a2ae3449b7ec9\n```\nIf the signature is valid, the command will output `true`.\n\nAfter verifying the download, you can extract the archive to the desired directory and use the Verus software.\n\nIt's also important to note that the Verus team recommends upgrading to the latest version of the software, especially if you're using the mainnet or testnet, to avoid potential issues with the RPC API.",

This fault while running is only caused by non-typical API, insight explorer, or CLI use, but if it does happen, may result in the need to rescan or resync your wallet. We know of no one on mainnet affected by this issue. We recommend that all users upgrade.",
