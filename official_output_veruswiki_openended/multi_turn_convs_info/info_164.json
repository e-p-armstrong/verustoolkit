            "What are some of the new capabilities of Verus, and how do they enable users to interact with VerusIDs, NFTs, and marketplaces in a decentralized and sovereign way?",
            "Verus has introduced several new capabilities that enhance its functionality and enable users to interact with VerusIDs, NFTs, and marketplaces in a decentralized and sovereign way. Some of these capabilities include:\n\n**On-Chain Launches of Tokens, Centralized Currencies, and Liquidity Basket AMMs:** Verus now allows for the on-chain launch of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs, which enables the creation of new digital assets and markets without the need for external infrastructure.\n\n**On-Chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains:** Verus enables the on-chain launch and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains, allowing for the creation of new blockchain networks that can interact with each other seamlessly.\n\n**On-Chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles:** Verus provides on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles, enabling users to manage their digital identities and assets in a decentralized and secure manner.\n\n**Verus ID and NFT Marketplace:** The Verus ID and NFT marketplace allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain, advertising their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, with the option to pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by the user. This enables a new economy of provable digital ownership, where owners can select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants.\n\nOverall, these new capabilities of Verus enable users to interact with VerusIDs, NFTs, and marketplaces in a decentralized and sovereign way, providing a high degree of control and flexibility over their digital assets and identities.",
            "Thanks to ejuliano#8606 for suggesting the initial idea that led to the realization that these features could be added quite easily and with very little protocol risk. All of these new capabilities have had full coverage testing and validation over the past week thanks to @Asherda\u2019s leadership on that front.Meanwhile, @alexenglish, @monkins1010, @asherda, quipacorn#5205, and others have been working on the Ethereum bridge deployment in preparation for this release. The testnet will transition to the v1.0.1 protocol with no reset required, Monday, May 8, 2023 4:00:00 PM, UTC.\n### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.",
