            "What are some advanced features of the Verus network that enable powerful use cases such as arbitrage, investment discovery, and conversion bargain hunting, as well as enhanced security and self-sovereignty for users?",
            "The Verus network offers several advanced features that enable powerful use cases and enhance security and self-sovereignty for users.\n\nOne of these features is the `getcurrencyconverters` RPC API, which allows for system-wide queries of fractional basket currencies. This enables instant queries of any full node for all registered currencies above a fixed liquidity threshold that contain one or more reserve currencies. This feature enables wallets or applications to easily query the entire blockchain network of fractional currencies, determine which provides the best conversion rate at acceptable liquidity, and either convert at the best possible rates worldwide or select only better-than-market rates and arbitrage to earn.\n\nAnother advanced feature is the enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology. This capability extends the already groundbreaking VerusID revocable, recoverable, provable, friendly name blockchain addresses and identities to include an advanced time lock capability. This time lock capability does not prevent staking on locked funds, enabling easy implementation of things like vesting, trusts, protocols for theft-proofing funds, simplifying estate planning, and much more. With Verus Vault technology, users can have complete control over their funds, identity, and estate planning in a fully self-sovereign manner, with the peace of mind in knowing they are protected from lost or stolen private keys.\n\nThese features enable powerful use cases such as arbitrage, investment discovery, and conversion bargain hunting, while also providing enhanced security and self-sovereignty for users.",
