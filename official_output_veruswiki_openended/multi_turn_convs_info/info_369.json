            "How do you define and launch a new currency on the Verus network, and how can you convert between different currencies?",
            "To define and launch a new currency on the Verus network, you need to follow a series of steps using the `verus` command-line tool.\n\n**Defining a Currency:**\nFirst, you need to define the currency using the `definecurrency` command. For example, to define a currency called \"gold\", you would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines the properties of the \"gold\" currency, such as its name, options, and conversion rates.\n\n**Launching a Currency:**\nTo launch the currency, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST and have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD. This process happens as part of the mining process, and mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD.\n\n**Converting Between Currencies:**\nAfter the currency is launched, you can convert between different currencies using the `sendcurrency` command. For example, to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command effectively parks the conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet, or you will have your VRSCTEST back.\n\n**Creating a New Currency:**\nTo create a new currency that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can use the `definecurrency` command again, specifying the properties of the new currency. For example, to create a currency called \"mycoin\", you would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines the properties of the \"mycoin\" currency, such as its name, options, proof protocol, currencies, and initial supply.\n\nIn summary, defining and launching a new currency on the Verus network involves using the `definecurrency` command to specify the properties of the currency, and then funding the identity of the currency and preconverting the necessary amounts to launch the currency. Once the currency is launched, you can convert between different currencies using the `sendcurrency` command.",
            "s, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
