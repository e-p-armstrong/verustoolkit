            "What kind of warranty or liability does the Verus software come with, and what kind of warnings might I encounter when installing it on my system?",
            "The Verus software is provided \"as is\", meaning that it does not come with any warranty or guarantee of any kind, whether express or implied. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Additionally, the authors and copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability that may arise from the use or other dealings in the software.\n\nWhen installing Verus, you may encounter warnings from your antivirus software, such as Avast or Kaspersky, flagging the software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). These warnings are not because the software is malicious, but rather because it is mining software, which can potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your system.\n\nIt's worth noting that these warnings are false positives, and you can find more information about them by reviewing resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky, which explain why these warnings are triggered. The Verus software is safe to use and does not pose a threat to your system.\n\nIt's also important to verify the integrity of the software by checking its digital signature and hash values, which can be found on the Verus website. This ensures that you are installing the genuine software and not a modified or tampered version.\n\nIn summary, the Verus software comes with no warranty or liability, and you may encounter warnings from your antivirus software due to its mining capabilities. However, these warnings are false positives, and the software is safe to use after verifying its integrity.",
