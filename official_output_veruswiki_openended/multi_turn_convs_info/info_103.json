            "What are some limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency in Verus, and what should I keep in mind when using this technology?",
            "When working with multi-currency in Verus, there are a few limitations to be aware of to ensure smooth operation.\n\nFirstly, when creating a currency from an ID, it's important to note that you cannot use an i-address as the actual name of the ID, rather than its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address as the name of an ID can cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used, and will not be supported for creating currencies. As a general rule, it's recommended to avoid making an ID with an i-address as its name.\n\nSecondly, in the Verus Desktop GUI, if a currency is already supported, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. However, this limitation is considered temporary and will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that the software is still experimental and unfinished, and should be used at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and users should be aware of this when using the technology.\n\nAdditionally, the software is open-source, and users are permitted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, as long as the enclosed copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.",
            "#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.### DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
