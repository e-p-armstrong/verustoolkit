            "What are some additional capabilities of Verus, and how does the Verus ID and NFT marketplace work?",
            "Verus has several additional capabilities that make it a powerful and versatile platform. Some of these capabilities include:\n\n* On-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs, allowing for the creation and deployment of new assets and financial instruments directly on the blockchain.\n* On-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming, enabling the creation of new blockchains and networks that can interact with each other seamlessly.\n* On-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles, providing a secure and decentralized way to manage identities and digital assets.\n\nThe Verus ID and NFT marketplace is a decentralized platform that allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. Here's how it works:\n\n* Users can advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see.\n* Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized way, without the need for intermediaries.\n* Payments can be made from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, which are still auditable by the user.\n* Users can accept payment to either type of address as well.\n* The on-chain model also allows owners to select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership.\n\nOverall, the Verus ID and NFT marketplace provides a secure, decentralized, and transparent way to manage and trade digital identities and assets. It's the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.",
            "Our next step is the testnet rollout of the Ethereum bridge, and after a few days of that proving out in final testing and review, we will deploy it on mainnet as soon as we believe it is ready for permanent use. Once the Ethereum bridge is live on mainnet, if we do ever need a contract upgrade, we will announce and coordinate with network validators, as each Ethereum contract upgrade will be independently subject to Verus miner and staker approval.Thanks everyone for upgrading as soon as you are able!### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see.
