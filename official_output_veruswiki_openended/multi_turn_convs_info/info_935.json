            "How do I park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches, and what are the possible outcomes of this action? Additionally, how do I create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST?",
            "To park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. Specifically, you would use the following format:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"your_address@\",\"convertto\":\"new_token\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the new token launches. After the launch, you will either find the converted amount of the new token in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nIn this specific example, if the new token is called \"gold\", you would expect to find either 0.975 GOLD in your wallet, or your original VRSCTEST amount back.\n\nOnce the new token has launched, you can create a new token, let's call it \"mycoin\", which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. To do this, you would use the `definecurrency` command, specifying the properties of the new token, such as its name, options, proof protocol, currencies it can be converted to, and initial supply.\n\nHere's an example of how you might define mycoin:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\", with the specified properties.",
            "dcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
