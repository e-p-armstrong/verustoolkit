            "How do I create a currency on the Verus platform, and what are the requirements for creating a currency with a specific name?",
            "To create a currency on the Verus platform, you need to have an ID with the same name as the currency you want to create. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once.\n\nLet's break down an example to illustrate this process. Suppose you have three IDs: `gold@`, `mycoin@`, and `mike@`. You want to create a currency called `gold@` that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold, and another currency called `mycoin@` that offers utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\n\nTo create the `gold@` currency, you would use the `definecurrency` command, specifying the name of the currency, options, currencies it can be converted to, conversion ratios, minimum pre-conversion amounts, and pre-allocations. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nIn this example, the `gold@` currency is defined with options set to 32, convertible to `vrsctest` with a conversion ratio of 0.01, a minimum pre-conversion amount of 1000, and a pre-allocation of 50,000,000.00000000 units to the `mike@` ID.\n\nNote that the controller of the `gold@` ID is the only one who can create a currency with this name, and they can only do so once. This ensures that the currency creation process is secure and trustworthy.\n\nSimilarly, you can create the `mycoin@` currency by defining its properties using the `definecurrency` command. The specifics of the currency definition will depend on the use case and requirements of the `mycoin@` currency.",
            "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start.
