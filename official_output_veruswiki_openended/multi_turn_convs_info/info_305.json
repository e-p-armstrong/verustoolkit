            "How do I create and register an identity on the Verus blockchain, and what are the steps involved in doing so?",
            "To create and register an identity on the Verus blockchain, you need to follow a two-step process: creating a name commitment and registering the identity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps involved:\n\n**Step 1: Create a Name Commitment**\nThe first step is to create a name commitment using the `registernamecommitment` command. This command requires three parameters: the name you want to register, your Verus address or ID, and the referrer's friendly name. The command should be in the following format:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registernamecommitment <Name> <youraddressorid> <referrerfriendlyname>@\n```\nThis command will respond with a JSON object containing information about the name commitment, including a transaction ID (txid), name reservation details, and other information.\n\n**Step 2: Register the Identity**\nOnce you have the name commitment, you need to wait for it to be mined into a block. After that, you can use the information returned in the previous step to register the identity using the `registeridentity` command. The command should be in the following format:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registeridentity '{\"txid\":\"<txid>\", \"namereservation\": {... }, \"identity\":{... }}'\n```\nReplace `<txid>` with the transaction ID returned in the previous step, and fill in the `namereservation` and `identity` objects with the required information.\n\n**Verifying and Managing Identities**\nOnce the registration transaction is mined into the blockchain, you can use your new identity in place of an address. You can list the identities in your wallet using the `listidentities` command, and display specific identities using the `getidentity` command. If you have the authority, you can also revoke and recover identities as needed.\n\nNote that creating and registering an identity on the Verus blockchain requires sufficient funds and a valid Verus address or ID.",
            "Create your commitment with the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registernamecommitment Name youraddressorid referrerfriendlyname@\nThat will respond with something like:\n{\n \"txid\": \"377576f8ada1acc2aeb013ddf7a9ad86756cb990d4c5fc70b5a9a0fca43d727e\",\n \"namereservation\": {\n  \"name\": \"Name\",\n  \"salt\": \"7b981f0a1ff2593167ef078150d0116335a7f329f9403b0abaeca30a42d8876a\",\n  \"referral\": \"iSJLKp1hvn51Zg2Y6FBKjzLs9AAy7fomWN\",\n  \"parent\": \"\",\n  \"nameid\": \"iDXx9FPrAS5k2XCGss6FFmDQQMsts63uUg\"\n }\n}\n```\nYou then wait for the commitment to be mined into a block, then use the information returned above as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST registeridentity '{\"txid\":\"377576f8ada1acc2aeb013ddf7a9ad86756cb990d4c5fc70b5a9a0fca43d727e\", \"namereservation\": {\n  \"name\": \"Name\", \"salt\": \"7b981f0a1ff2593167ef078150d0116335a7f329f9403b0abaeca30a42d8876a\", \"referral\":\"referrerfriendlyname@\"}, \"identity\":{\"name\":\"Name\", \"primaryaddresses\":[\"RKo5u8N1sStZu81fU8kaxhoDcFcJmNEwSp\"], \"minimumsignatures\":1, \"privateaddress\":\"zs14y0aa096em2as6n4fauyumqeywz45rfpze38c39fksgtjsac9vmms7fmstcylpaalm7rseu8838\"}}'\n```\nAs long as you have enough funds and you are registering a new identity on the blockchain, you will be able to use your new identity in place of an address as soon as the transaction created by the registration command is mined into the blockchain.\nYou may list the identities in your wallet with the command `listidentities`, and you may display specific identities with the command `getidentity`. If you have the authority, or use identities under your control as revocation or recovery authorities for other identities, you may also revoke and recovery identities as well.",
