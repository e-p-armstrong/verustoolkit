            "The `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert funds between different addresses and currencies. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST from a Single Address:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient using the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to the address `alice@`.\n\n**Sending VRSCTEST from All Private Wallet Funds:**\nYou can send VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients using the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nThis command sends 10 VRSCTEST from all private wallet funds to the addresses `alice@:private` and `bob@:private`.\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to a Fractional Basket Currency:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, such as VRSC-BTC, using the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to VRSC-BTC.\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to Another Reserve:**\nYou can convert VRSCTEST to another reserve, such as BTC, through a fractional currency, such as VRSC-BTC, using the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nThis command converts 10 VRSCTEST from the address `bob@` to BTC through the VRSC-BTC currency.\n\nThese are just a few examples of how you can use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus to send and convert funds. The API is highly customizable and can be used to perform a wide range of transactions and conversions.",
