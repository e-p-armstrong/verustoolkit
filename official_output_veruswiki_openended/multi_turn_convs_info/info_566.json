            "Here are some essential Verus CLI commands that you can use to manage your wallet, send and receive VRSC coins, and shield rewards:\n\n**Getting Wallet Information:**\nTo get information about your wallet, including immature and staking balances, you can use the `verus getwalletinfo` command. This command provides a detailed overview of your wallet's current state.\n\n**Sending VRSC Coins:**\nTo send VRSC coins from your Verus wallet to another VRSC address, you can use the `verus sendtoaddress` command. The format for this command is `verus sendtoaddress \"<VRSC_address>\" <AMOUNT> \"<Some comments here>\"`. This command allows you to specify the recipient's address, the amount of VRSC coins to send, and an optional comment.\n\n**Listing Transactions:**\nTo list the latest VRSC transactions, you can use the `verus listtransactions` command. This command provides a list of recent transactions related to your wallet.\n\n**Shielding Rewards:**\nTo shield reward coins from all public addresses, you can use the `verus z_shieldcoinbase` command. The format for this command is `verus z_shieldcoinbase \"*\" \"<z-ADDRESS>\"`. This command allows you to shield rewards and send them to a z-address.\n\n**Transferring VRSX Coins:**\nTo transfer X VRSX coins from any address (P-, i-, or z-) to any other address (P-, i-, or z-), you can use the `verus z_sendmany` command. The format for this command is `verus z_sendmany \"<z-, i- or P-ADDRESS>\" '[{\"amount\":<X>, \"address\":\"<Z-, i- or P-ADDRESS>\"}]'`. This command allows you to specify the sender's address, the amount of VRSX coins to transfer, and the recipient's address.\n\n**Checking Operation Status:**\nTo check the operation status of your `z_sendmany` command or `z_shieldconbase` command, you can use the `verus z_getoperationstatus` command. This command provides information on the status of your previous operations.\n\n**Getting Help:**\nFinally, if you need more information on any of these commands or want to learn about other Verus CLI commands, you can use the `verus help` command. This command provides detailed documentation on each command and their usage.",
