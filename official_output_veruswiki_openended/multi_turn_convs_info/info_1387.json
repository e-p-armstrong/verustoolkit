            "To define a new currency called \"mycoin\" on the VRSCTEST chain, you can use the `definecurrency` command with the following format:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new currency named \"mycoin\" with the following properties:\n\n* `name`: The name of the currency, which is \"mycoin\".\n* `options`: An integer that defines additional properties of the currency, which is set to 97 in this case.\n* `proofprotocol`: The proof protocol used by the currency, which is set to 2 (PROOF_CHAINID) in this case. This means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins.\n* `currencies`: An array of currencies that can be converted to \"mycoin\", which includes \"vrsctest\" and \"gold\" in this case.\n* `minpreconversion`: An array that defines the minimum amounts of each currency required to convert to \"mycoin\", which is [10000, 5.1298] in this case.\n* `initialsupply`: The initial supply of \"mycoin\", which is set to 20,000 units in this case.\n\nOnce \"mycoin\" is defined, the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins using the `sendcurrency` command with the `mintnew` option:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n\nThis command mints 10,000 new units of \"mycoin\" and sends them to the address \"mike@\".\n\nFinally, to reset the testnet on a Linux system, you need to delete the following directories:\n\n* `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST`\n* `~/.verustest`\n\nAfter deleting these directories, you can launch the testnet again.",
            "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":97, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":[20000]'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\n## Testnet Reset Instructions\n**Please delete the following directories before launching the testnet:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/VRSCTEST\n~/.verustest\n```",
