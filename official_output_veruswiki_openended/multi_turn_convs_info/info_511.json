            "What are the key features and benefits of the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does Verus Vault protect funds on a VerusID?",
            "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on-chain, in a completely decentralized manner. This means that users can advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed peer-to-peer, without the need for intermediaries, and can be made from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses. This provides a high level of privacy and security, while still allowing for auditing and tracking of transactions.\n\nOne of the key benefits of the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is that it enables owners to select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. This creates a new level of flexibility and control for users, and opens up new opportunities for creators and owners of digital assets.\n\nVerus Vault is an additional feature that provides an extra layer of security and protection for funds on a VerusID. By locking a VerusID with Vault, users can prevent funds from being spent from that identity, even if the private key is compromised. This provides an added layer of protection against theft and unauthorized access. While a VerusID is locked with Vault, users can still stake their funds on the Verus network and earn rewards, and can also still receive funds. It's important to note that enabling revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities requires users to have at least one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.\n\nOverall, the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, along with Verus Vault, provide a powerful and flexible platform for users to manage and protect their digital assets, while also enabling new opportunities for creators and owners of digital assets.",
            "#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.#### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.",
