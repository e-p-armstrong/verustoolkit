            "What is the process of creating a new Verus identity, and how does it work?",
            "Creating a Verus identity is a two-step process designed to prevent \"name front running,\" where a miner might replace your purchase of an ID with their own purchase of the same name. To create a Verus identity, you need to follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Commit to a name**\nThe first step is to commit to a friendly name that you want to use for your identity. This name must be unique to the blockchain, so if someone already has the name you want, you'll need to either be the first to purchase it or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization. When you commit to a name, it is kept secret until you register it and reveal your commitment.\n\n**Step 2: Register your identity**\nIn the second step, you need to register your identity and reveal your commitment. To do this, you'll need to pay a fee of 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has a Verus identity. With a referral, the fee is reduced to 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register your identity using the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money is automatically spent along with your registration.\n\n**Benefits of having a Verus identity**\nOnce you have created your Verus identity, you can use a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. This makes it easier to send money to others, as you can use their friendly name instead of their blockchain address. For example, you can use commands like `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ \u2018[{\u201caddress\u201d:\u201dalice@\u201d, \u201camount\u201d:100}]\u2019` or `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100` to send money to others.\n\nOverall, creating a Verus identity provides a convenient and secure way to interact with the Verus blockchain, making it easier to send and receive money using friendly names instead of complex blockchain addresses.",
            "## Making a new identity\nArguably, the hardest part of the new Verus identity technology is just making your first identity, especially without a GUI. Once you have your own identity, a lot becomes easier, not the least of which is the ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. For example, once you have your identity, either of the following commands will work as well as just about any other CLI command that takes an address:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ \u2018[{\u201caddress\u201d:\u201dalice@\u201d, \u201camount\u201d:100}]\u2019\n```\nor\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100\n```\nMaking a Verus ID requires two steps, steps that are designed to prevent potentially selfish miners from replacing your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead. To prevent this name \u201cfront running\u201d, you must first commit to a name that you wish to have in your identity as its friendly name. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you must have, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.Creating a name commitment registers your commitment, but keeps the name completely secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without and 80 VRSC with a referral is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows:",
