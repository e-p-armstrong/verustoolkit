            "My Verus wallet is stuck on a certain block number and won't synchronize properly. What steps can I take to resolve this issue and get my wallet working again?",
            "If your Verus wallet is stuck on a specific block number and won't synchronize with the blockchain, there are several steps you can take to resolve this issue.\n\n**Step 1: Check your block height**\nFirst, check your wallet's block height and compare it to the current block height on the Verus blockchain using the explorer link provided. If your wallet's block height is significantly lower (more than 10 blocks behind), then you can proceed with the following steps.\n\n**Step 2: Close your wallet**\nClose your Verus wallet to ensure that it's not running while you make changes to the configuration files.\n\n**Step 3: Add nodes to your VRSC.conf file**\nLocate the VRSC.conf file in the standard location for your operating system (e.g., `~/.komodo/VRSC` for Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC` for Mac OS, or `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\` for Windows 10). Add the following lines to the bottom of the file, just below `rpcallowip=127.0.0.1`:\n```\naddnode=157.90.113.198:27485\naddnode=95.217.1.76:27485\n```\nThese lines add new nodes to your wallet's configuration, which can help it connect to the blockchain and synchronize properly.\n\n**Step 4: Get an up-to-date list of working nodes (optional)**\nIf you want to get an up-to-date list of working nodes, you can join the Verus Discord channel and message `/peerinfo` in the #tipbot channel. This will give you a list of current nodes that you can add to your VRSC.conf file.\n\n**Step 5: Remove the peers.dat file**\nAfter adding the new nodes, remove the `peers.dat` file from the VRSC folder. Be careful not to remove any other files or folders, as this can cause problems with your wallet. You can rename or move the `peers.dat` file to a different location if you're unsure.\n\n**Step 6: Start your wallet again**\nFinally, start your Verus wallet as you normally would. Your wallet should now be able to connect to the blockchain and synchronize properly.\n\nRemember to be careful when modifying your wallet's configuration files, and make sure you don't remove any important files or folders. If you're still having trouble with your wallet, you may need to bootstrap it, which is a more involved process.",
            "# My wallet is stuck on block number XXXX. It does not synchronize properly anymore.note: Read it completely before use.### Verus `Wallet.dat`, Chaindata & `VRSC.conf` standard locations\n * Linux:\t\t`~/.komodo/VRSC`\n * Mac OS: \t`~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`\n * Windows 10: \t`%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`\n * OS independent through Verus Desktop: Click `help`, `Show Verus data folder (default)`#### Usefull links:\nLink 1: [Download latest Wallet](https://verus.io/wallet.html)\nLink 2: [Show current blockheight](https://explorer.verus.io/api/getblockcount)## Procedure:\nIn case your wallet is not synchronized with the blockchain and restarting doesn't connect to any peers:Compare your blockheight with the one Link 2 above is showing to make sure you are\nnot synchronized anymore. If the blockheight of the link above is significantly higher (more than 10) than\nthe blockheight your wallet is showing, follow the rest of the procedure.\nIf the numbers are equal or close, your wallet is synchronized and the procedure below will not solve any problems.Close your wallet.\nGo to the appropriate location for your OS as mentioned above.Add a similar list to the bottom of your `VRSC.conf`, just below `rpcallowip=127.0.0.1`:\n```\n addnode=157.90.113.198:27485\n addnode=95.217.1.76:27485\n```\nSave and exit the file.\nAn up-to-date list of working nodes can be found in Verus Discord in the #tipbot channel, by messaging `/peerinfo` in that channel.After you added nodes, remove `peers.dat` that is in the VRSC folder.\n(At least rename or move to a different location).\nMake sure you don't remove any other files/folders, or you'll have to [bootstrap](http://blacksquare/#!how-to/how-to_bootstrap.md) your wallet.\nThen start your wallet as you're used to.",
