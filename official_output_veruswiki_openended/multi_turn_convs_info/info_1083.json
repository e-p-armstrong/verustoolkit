            "What are the benefits of launching a new blockchain on the Verus network, and how does Verus enable seamless connectivity and interoperability between multiple blockchains?",
            "Launching a new blockchain on the Verus network offers several benefits, including the ability to generate fees via cross-chain fee conversions and general use of the liquidity pool, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This means that all fees earned are retained on the new blockchain, providing a lucrative opportunity for blockchain creators.\n\nOne of the key features of Verus is its ability to facilitate blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds. This means that creators can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimum levels are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of their pre-conversions, minus network fees.\n\nVerus also provides a range of launch options, including maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Additionally, launches can include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations using VerusIDs.\n\nAnother significant advantage of Verus is its ability to enable seamless connectivity and interoperability between multiple blockchains. The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains, with decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation provided by Notary IDs. This enables public blockchains to be available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains that are easy to set up with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back.\n\nVerus enables unlimited scale, with no limit on the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross-notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network provides a scalable and flexible solution for blockchain creators. Overall, Verus offers a robust and versatile platform for launching and operating blockchains, with a range of features and benefits that make it an attractive option for creators.",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access.
