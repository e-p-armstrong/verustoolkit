            "How does the Verus DeFi protocol address liquidity pool issues, and what features does it offer for launching new blockchains and crowdfunding currency launches?",
            "The Verus DeFi protocol addresses liquidity pool issues by ensuring that all currency conversions using a particular liquidity pool and mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This approach solves the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers. This ensures smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n\nOne of the key features of the Verus DeFi protocol is the ability to launch a new blockchain simultaneously with a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This bridge converter liquidity pool is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This provides seamless connectivity between the new blockchain and the Verus ecosystem.\n\nAnother feature of the Verus DeFi protocol is the ability to launch crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds. This allows users to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, and similarly price-neutral carve-outs.\n\nOverall, the Verus DeFi protocol provides a robust and flexible framework for launching new blockchains and crowdfunding currency launches, while addressing liquidity pool issues and providing incentives for miners and stakers.",

Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)\n- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs",
