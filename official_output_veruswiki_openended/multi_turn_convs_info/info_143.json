            "What is the purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to `2` when defining a new currency in Verus, and how does it affect the minting of new coins?",
            "When defining a new currency in Verus, setting `proofprotocol` to `2` means that the currency will use `PROOF_CHAINID` as its proof protocol. This has a significant implication for the minting of new coins.\n\n`PROOF_CHAINID` is a proof protocol that allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. This means that the entity controlling the chain ID has the authority to create new coins and add them to the circulating supply.\n\nIn the context of the example provided, when we define the new currency \"mycoin\" with `proofprotocol` set to `2`, we are allowing the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. This is demonstrated by the subsequent command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command instructs the controller of the chain ID to mint 10,000 new coins of \"mycoin\" and send them to the address `mike@`. The `mintnew` parameter is set to `1`, indicating that this is a minting operation.\n\nIn summary, setting `proofprotocol` to `2` when defining a new currency in Verus enables the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins, allowing for centralized control over the currency's supply.",
            "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
