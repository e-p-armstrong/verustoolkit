            "What are the various ways to use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus, and how do I define a new currency?",
            "The `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert funds in various ways. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\n**Sending Funds from a Single Address:**\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` API to send funds from a single address to a single recipient. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from `bob@` to `alice@`, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Sending Funds from All Wallet Funds:**\nYou can also use the `sendcurrency` API to send funds from all wallet funds to multiple recipients. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to both `alice@` and `bob@`, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Converting Funds to a Fractional Basket Currency:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API can also be used to convert funds to a fractional basket currency. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to VRSC-BTC, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\n**Converting Funds to Another Reserve:**\nYou can also use the `sendcurrency` API to convert funds to another reserve through a fractional currency. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to BTC through VRSC-BTC, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\n**Preconverting to a New Currency:**\nFinally, you can use the `sendcurrency` API to preconvert funds to a new currency before it is active. For example, to preconvert 10 VRSCTEST to NEWCOIN before it is active, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\n**Defining a New Currency:**\nTo define a new currency, you need to have an ID of the same name as the currency. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. For example, if you have an ID named `gold@`, you can define a currency called `gold` that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold. Similarly, if you have an ID named `mycoin@`, you can define a currency called `mycoin` that has utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\n\nNote that defining a new currency requires a thorough understanding of the currency's properties and use cases, as well as the technical capabilities of the Verus platform.",
            "The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.\n- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n  ```\n- **Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n  ```\n- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n  ```\n- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n  ```\n- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n  ```## Defining a CurrencyTo create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n",
