            "What are some of the additional capabilities of Verus, including on-chain launches and marketplaces, and how do they enable decentralized, secure, and self-sovereign transactions and identities?",
            "Verus offers a range of additional capabilities that enable decentralized, secure, and self-sovereign transactions and identities. Some of these capabilities include:\n\n**On-chain Launches:** Verus allows for on-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs, enabling the creation of new digital assets and financial instruments without the need for programming.\n\n**On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent Blockchains:** Verus also enables the launch and merge mining of independent, connected, and interoperable blockchains without programming, allowing for the creation of decentralized, interconnected networks.\n\n**On-chain Self Sovereign Identities, NFTs, and Profiles:** Verus enables the creation of on-chain, self-sovereign identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles, which can be used to represent individuals, organizations, or assets on the blockchain.\n\n**Verus ID and NFT Marketplace:** The Verus ID and NFT marketplace allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain, advertising offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting sales on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions can be executed in a completely decentralized way, with payment and receipt of funds possible from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, still auditable by the user.\n\n**Verus Vault:** Verus Vault provides an additional layer of security for VerusID holders, allowing them to lock their VerusID and protect funds from theft, even if a private key is compromised. While locked, funds can still be staked on the Verus network and earn rewards, and can still receive funds. However, it is important to note that enabling revocation, recovery, and all Verus Vault capabilities requires the configuration of at least one primary identity and one revocation/recovery ID.\n\nOverall, these additional capabilities of Verus enable a decentralized, secure, and self-sovereign ecosystem for transactions, identities, and assets, providing users with greater control and freedom over their digital lives.",
            "# Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.",
