    "What is the purpose of setting `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency using the Verus command line, and how does it enable the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins?",
    "When defining a new currency using the Verus command line, setting `proofprotocol` to 2, which is equivalent to PROOF_CHAINID, allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. This means that the entity controlling the chain ID has the authority to create new coins and add them to the circulating supply of the currency.\n\nIn the example provided, the command `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'` defines a new currency called \"mycoin\" with a `proofprotocol` set to 2. This setting enables the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins.\n\nTo mint new coins, the controller of the chain ID can use the `sendcurrency` command, as shown in the example: `./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'`. This command mints 10,000 new coins of \"mycoin\" and sends them to the address \"mike@\".\n\nIn summary, setting `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency using the Verus command line enables the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins, allowing them to control the supply of the currency and perform actions such as creating new coins or incentivizing certain behaviors within the ecosystem.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
