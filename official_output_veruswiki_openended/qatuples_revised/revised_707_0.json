    "What are some of the connection options available in Verus, and how do they affect the behavior of the node?",
    "Verus provides various connection options to customize the behavior of the node. These options can be used to control how the node connects to other nodes, how it handles peer connections, and how it maintains its connection to the network.\n\n**Spent Index and Insight Explorer:**\nTwo options, `-spentindex` and `-insightexplorer`, are related to indexing and querying the blockchain. The `-spentindex` option, enabled by default, maintains a full spent index, which can be used to query the spending txid and input index for an outpoint. The `-insightexplorer` option, when enabled, forces the `addressindex`, `spentindex`, and `timestampindex` options to be enabled, and when disabled, forces `timestampindex` to be disabled.\n\n**Node Connection Options:**\nSeveral options are available to control how the node connects to other nodes. The `-addnode` option allows you to add a node to connect to and attempt to keep the connection open. The `-connect` option specifies a node to connect to exclusively. The `-bind` option binds the node to a specific address and always listens on it.\n\n**Peer Connection Options:**\nOptions are available to control how the node handles peer connections. The `-banscore` option sets a threshold for disconnecting misbehaving peers, and the `-bantime` option specifies the number of seconds to keep misbehaving peers from reconnecting. The `-maxconnections` option sets a maximum number of connections to peers.\n\n**Proxy and DNS Options:**\nOptions are available to control how the node uses proxies and DNS lookups. The `-externalip` option specifies the node's own public address. The `-dns` option allows DNS lookups for `-addnode`, `-seednode`, and `-connect` options. The `-dnsseed` option queries for peer addresses via DNS lookup if the node is low on addresses. The `-forcednsseed` option always queries for peer addresses via DNS lookup.\n\n**Tor and Onion Options:**\nOptions are available to control how the node uses Tor and onion connections. The `-listenonion` option automatically creates a Tor hidden service. The `-onion` option specifies a separate SOCKS5 proxy to reach peers via Tor hidden services.\n\nThese connection options provide flexibility and customization for Verus nodes, allowing users to tailor their node's behavior to their specific needs.",
