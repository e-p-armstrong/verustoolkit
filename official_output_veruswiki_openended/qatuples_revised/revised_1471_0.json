    "What are some of the unique capabilities of the Verus PBaaS system, and how do they enable a decentralized future with truth and privacy for all?",
    "The Verus PBaaS system offers several unique capabilities that set it apart from other decentralized platforms. Two examples of these capabilities are the VerusID protocol and the Verus Vault system.\n\n**VerusID Protocol:**\nThe VerusID protocol enables the creation of self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable identities. This means that users can register friendly name strong identities and fund addresses that are fully under their control. They can revoke these identities if needed, and recover them later. This feature is currently available on the mainnet.\n\n**Verus Vault System:**\nThe Verus Vault system is a staking-capable time locking and theft prevention system. It allows users to lock their identities, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked. However, it still enables seamless staking of funds. When a user locks their identity, they specify an unlock delay, which is typically long enough to notice if someone has compromised their keys. The only way to circumvent this unlock delay is to revoke and recover the ID. Users can also create and use fresh private keys when unlocking their ID, making it virtually theft-proof.\n\nThese capabilities enable a decentralized future with truth and privacy for all by providing users with full control over their identities and funds. They also provide a solution to common problems such as inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, and identity theft. Additionally, VerusIDs can be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network, making it a powerful tool for decentralized applications.",
    "As Verus PBaaS offers completely new capabilities that go beyond today\u2019s decentralized platforms in many fundamental ways, the worldwide Verus community put its energy into creation, rather than convincing everyone that its capabilities are possible. Members across the Verus worldwide community have worked hard to make this all possible, and we are more than excited that you can now experience it firsthand. If you have an interest in the future of crypto, you owe it to yourself to learn about Verus, an unlimited scale, decentralized future with truth and privacy for all.### The Verus testnet, available in the Verus Desktop or cli wallets as the VRSCTEST coin, has the following capabilities, which to our knowledge are unique in crypto today.### Self sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities (currently on mainnet) VerusID\n- Enables permissionless registration of friendly name strong identities and funds addresses that are simultaneously fully self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable.\n## Staking-capable time locking and theft prevention (Verus Vault)\n- Enables identities to be locked, preventing any funds under their control from being spent while locked, but still allowing seamless staking of funds. When locked, a user specifies an unlock delay, typically long enough to notice when someone who might have compromised a user\u2019s keys would have to unlock the ID before spending. The only way to circumvent the unlock delay is to revoke and recover an ID. Users may also choose to create and use fresh private keys when unlocking an ID as well. This enables virtually theft proof workflow and a solution to inheritance, trusts, vesting schedules, the 5$ wrench attack, and identity theft. IDs may be used as friendly name cryptocurrency addresses for all currencies on all Verus PBaaS blockchains in the Verus network. The VerusID protocol is a protocol, which can also be impleme",
