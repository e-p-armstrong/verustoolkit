    "What are some limitations I should be aware of when working with multi-currency on Verus, and what steps do I need to take if I've updated from a previous version of VRSCTEST?",
    "When working with multi-currency on Verus, there are two important limitations to be aware of.\n\n**Limitation 1: IDs with i-addresses as names**\nIn both the GUI and CLI, you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. To avoid potential user confusion, it's generally advised not to create IDs with i-addresses as names, as this can cause problems in various cases.\n\n**Limitation 2: Conflicting currency names in the GUI**\nIn the GUI, you cannot use the same name for a PBaaS chain as a currency that is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH. This limitation is considered errata and will be resolved before mainnet availability.\n\n**Upgrading from a previous version of VRSCTEST**\nIf you've updated from a previous version of VRSCTEST, you need to delete the following directories before running the new update:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/vrsctest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`\n\nBy taking these steps, you'll ensure a smooth transition to the new version of VRSCTEST.",
    "## Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.## Testnet Reset\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched on this release. **IF YOU HAVE LAST LAUNCHED VRSCTEST FROM A VERSION PRIOR TO THIS, PLEASE DELETE THE FOLLOWING DIRECTORIES BEFORE RUNNING THIS NEW UPDATE:**\n**Linux:**\n```\n~/.komodo/vrsctest\n```**MacOS**\n```\n \u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest\n```**Windows**\n```\n\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST\n```# Disclaimer",
