    "How do I create a currency with a specific name on the Verus platform, and what are the requirements and implications of doing so?",
    "On the Verus platform, creating a currency with a specific name requires an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. This means that if you want to create a currency called \"gold@\", for example, you need to have an ID named \"gold@\".\n\nHaving control over an ID with a specific name gives you the power to launch a currency with that name. This can be useful for various use cases, such as mapping a currency to a specific, auditable store of gold, as in the example of \"gold@\". In this scenario, the controller of the \"gold@\" ID can create a currency that is trusted to represent a certain amount of gold, providing a way to digitize and transfer the value of gold.\n\nAnother example is creating a token like \"mycoin@\", which could be used for a crowdfunding platform like Kickstarter. The controller of the \"mycoin@\" ID can launch a currency that represents a specific project or business, allowing people to invest and participate in the project.\n\nIt's essential to note that the creation of a currency on Verus is a one-time event, and the controller of the ID has full control over the currency's properties and behavior. This means that careful planning and consideration should be given to the creation of a currency, as it can have significant implications for its users and the overall ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, creating a currency with a specific name on Verus requires an ID of the same name, and the controller of that ID has the power to launch and manage the currency. This provides a way to create trusted and auditable digital representations of value, whether it's a store of gold or a crowdfunding project.",
    "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business,",
