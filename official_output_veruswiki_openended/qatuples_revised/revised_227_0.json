    "What are the features and capabilities of a Verus PBaaS blockchain, and how do currencies work within the Verus ecosystem?",
    "A Verus PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) blockchain is a fully independent, rent-free blockchain that offers a range of features and capabilities. Some of the key features of a Verus PBaaS blockchain include:\n\n* **Automatic Ethereum ERC20 contract deployment**: Verus PBaaS blockchains can automatically deploy Ethereum ERC20 contracts, making it easy to integrate with the Ethereum ecosystem.\n* **Auto-created and merge mineable**: Verus PBaaS blockchains can be automatically created and are merge mineable, making it easy to launch and maintain a blockchain.\n* **MEV-resistant and auto-bridged**: Verus PBaaS blockchains are resistant to Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and can be auto-bridged to other blockchains, allowing for seamless interactions between different blockchain networks.\n* **Liquidity baskets**: Verus PBaaS blockchains support liquidity baskets, which allow for multiple currencies to be grouped together and traded simultaneously.\n* **DeFi AMM conversions**: Verus PBaaS blockchains support DeFi AMM (Automated Market Maker) conversions, which are verified via mining and staking as part of the L1 consensus protocol.\n\nIn terms of currencies, Verus offers a range of features and capabilities, including:\n\n* **Currencies as primitives at L1**: Currencies are primitives at Layer 1 (L1) and are validated and verified on UTXO transactions, which check all inputs and outputs.\n* **Multi-currency capabilities**: Verus PBaaS blockchains support multiple currencies, which can be sent back and forth between different blockchain networks.\n* **Mapped currencies**: Verus allows currencies to be defined as \"mapped currencies\", which map 1:1 to an existing currency on Ethereum, such as DAI.\n* **Fundraising options**: Currency launches on Verus can raise funds in three ways, including fundraising options that create currencies that are not 100% backed and have prices that respond to market forces.\n\nOverall, Verus PBaaS blockchains offer a range of features and capabilities that make it easy to launch and maintain a blockchain, and to create and trade multiple currencies within the Verus ecosystem.",
    " missed targets, automatic Ethereum ERC20 contract deployment, auto-created, MEV-resistant, liquidity baskets and even auto-bridged, merge mineable, fully independent rent-free PBaaS blockchain launches.\n- All DeFi AMM conversions are verified via mining and staking as part of the L1 consensus protocol. All conversions in a single liquidity basket are calculated simultaneously for all transactions in any given block, meaning all participants get the same price in all directions of conversion, with a minimum conversion fee of 0.025% and a maximum of 0.05%.\n- All currencies and identities are primitives at L1 and are validated and verified on UTXO transactions, which check all inputs and outputs just as single currency L1, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin check the native currency inputs and outputs of transactions.\n- All currencies on all independent connected chains, once launched can be sent back and forth to other multi-currency capable networks (currently other independent PBaaS chains and Ethereum as ERC20s).\n- Currencies on Verus can also be defined as \"mapped currencies\", which map 1:1 to an existing currency on Ethereum (eg. DAI), and can then be sent from Ethereum with simple transactions and received and used as the new \"mapped currency\", or sent back to Ethereum and used there as the original currency.\n- Currency launches can raise funds in 3 ways. Each of these fundraising options creates a currency that is not 100% backed, and has a price that responds to market forces. 100% backed currencies do not change their relative price to the underlying basket reserve when they are converted to or from reserves. Fractionally backed currencies, which result from fundraising or endowing launch grants/pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, whether time-locked or not, take their funding from a percentage of the reserve backing.
