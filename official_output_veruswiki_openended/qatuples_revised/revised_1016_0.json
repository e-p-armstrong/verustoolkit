    "What are the new capabilities and features introduced in the latest Verus release, specifically related to testnet, block times, and PBaaS chain configuration?",
    "The latest Verus release introduces several new capabilities and features, particularly related to testnet, block times, and PBaaS chain configuration. One of the key features is the ability to support 10-second block times on testnet, which was pioneered by CHIPS developer @Biz. This modification to the Verus PoP algorithm enables the CHIPS chain to move towards becoming an interoperable, merge mineable PBaaS chain with a 10-second block time when PBaaS goes live on mainnet.\n\nIn addition, the new release allows for greater customization of PBaaS chain parameters. Specifically, the block time and PoW averaging window for any PBaaS chain's PoP consensus can be configured between 10 seconds and 2 minutes, along with its notarization frequency, as part of the chain definition. This increased flexibility enables a wider range of PBaaS use cases, transaction throughput, and application capabilities.\n\nFurthermore, the release provides access to the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge, which allows for cross-chain transactions and conversions between Verus and Ethereum's Goerli testnet. To utilize these features, users need to obtain some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.\n\nOverall, these new capabilities and features pave the way for more advanced and flexible PBaaS chain configurations, enabling a wider range of use cases and applications on the Verus network.",
    "This release also includes a new capability for testnet, which was pioneered by CHIPS developer @Biz, who worked to modify and test the Verus PoP algorithm to support 10 second block times, which the CHIPS chain uses to enable its game application focus. These new parameters will enable the CHIPS blockchain to move to being an interoperable, merge mineable PBaaS chain with a 10 second blocktime when PBaaS goes live on mainnet. To learn how to test the new CHIPS test chain on testnet, visit the #pbaas-development channel, as the support in v0.9.4-5 is not as complete as it will be in the next and hopefully final testnet reset. In that next version, blocktime and the pow averaging window for any PBaaS chain\u2019s PoP consensus will be able to be configured between 10 seconds and 2 minutes in addition to its notarization frequency as part of the chain definition, enabling a greater variety of PBaaS use cases, transaction throughput, and application capabilities.As a reminder, you can access the Verus <-> Ethereum testnet bridge here: https://ethtest.verus.services , using your metamask, converting or sending cross chain through the Verus network from Ethereum's Goerli. To use these features you will need to get some Goerli Ethereum, either from a faucet or via the Verus testnet liquidity baskets on Verus.The rest of these release notes are the same as the prior release. We encourage you to drop by the #pbaas-development channel, help the community prepare for mainnet and start building your vision today!",
