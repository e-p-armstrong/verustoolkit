    "How do I create a currency of a specific name on the Verus platform, and what are the requirements and implications of doing so, using IDs and currency names as examples?",
    "On the Verus platform, creating a currency of a specific name requires having an ID with the same name. The controller of this ID has exclusive rights to create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once. This means that the ID and currency names are closely tied, and the ID controller has control over the creation and management of the currency.\n\nTo illustrate this, let's consider an example. Suppose we have three IDs: `gold@`, `mycoin@`, and `mike@`. If we want to create a currency called `gold@`, we need to have an ID with the same name, `gold@`. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency with this name, and they can only do so once.\n\nIn this example, we might want to create a currency called `gold@` that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold. This would require the controller of the `gold@` ID to establish a trusted mapping between the currency and the gold reserve.\n\nSimilarly, if we want to create a token called `mycoin@`, we would need to have an ID with the same name, `mycoin@`. The controller of this ID could then create a currency with this name, which might be used for a specific purpose, such as a Kickstarter-like project.\n\nIt's important to note that the ID and currency names are unique, and the controller of the ID has full control over the creation and management of the currency. This ensures that the currency is securely tied to the ID and can be trusted by users.",

I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a busines",
