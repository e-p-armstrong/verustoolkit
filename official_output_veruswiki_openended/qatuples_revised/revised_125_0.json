    "What are the fundraising options available for a currency launch on the Verus platform, and how do they work?",
    "On the Verus platform, fundraising options for a currency launch are designed to be fractionally backed, meaning that the value of the currency will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it. If a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options not being met, no fundraising is received. There are three main fundraising options available:\n\n**Pre-launch Discount:**\nThis option offers a discount to participants who contribute to the launch before it goes live on its start block. This discount is applied to the initial on-chain price of the currency. To ensure that the currency remains in demand when it launches, a maximum cap is usually placed on pre-conversion participation.\n\n**Pre-launch Carve-out:**\nThis option allows a percentage of each initial participation currency to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price-neutral manner. The carved-out amount is sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch.\n\n**Pre-allocation:**\nThis option enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price-neutral manner, and the pre-allocated amount is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients of the pre-allocated currency can optionally be time-locked IDs, which can be used for vesting or unlock periods.\n\nThese fundraising options provide flexibility and incentives for participants to contribute to a currency launch on the Verus platform.",

If a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options that are not met, no fundraising is received:\n - Pre-launch discount - all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block get a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency. This is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency would still be in demand when it goes live.\n- Pre-launch carve-out - this enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch.\n- Pre-allocation - this enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price neutral manner, and again is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods.",
