    "The Verus protocol offers several advanced capabilities and features that enhance the functionality of VerusIDs and the Verus ecosystem. These features include:\n\n**On-Chain Launches and Merge Mining:** Verus enables the on-chain launch of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket Automated Market Makers (AMMs) without requiring any programming. Additionally, it allows for the on-chain launch and merge mining of independent, connected, and interoperable blockchains.\n\n**Verus ID and NFT Marketplace:** The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform that enables the buying and selling of VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. This allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized manner, allowing for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries.\n\n**Verus Vault:** Verus Vault is a feature that provides an additional layer of security for VerusID holders. By locking their VerusID with Vault, users can protect their funds from theft, even if their private key is compromised. While locked, users cannot spend funds from their VerusID, but they can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. Additionally, users can still receive funds while their VerusID is locked.\n\nThese features enhance the functionality of VerusIDs and the Verus ecosystem by providing a more robust and secure platform for users to manage their digital identities and assets. They also enable new use cases and opportunities for decentralized applications and services to be built on top of the Verus protocol.",

This version does not support testnet, but a future version will be released shortly to support it. For more information on running testnet, please refer to the previous release or the next one.\n# Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.",
