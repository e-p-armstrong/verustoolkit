    "What are some of the advanced features and capabilities of Verus, including its on-chain capabilities, Verus ID and NFT marketplace, and Verus Vault?",
    "Verus has several advanced features and capabilities that make it a powerful and versatile platform. \n\n**On-Chain Capabilities:** \nVerus allows for on-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs. Additionally, it enables on-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, and interoperable blockchains without requiring any programming knowledge. This makes it possible to create complex blockchain ecosystems with ease.\n\n**Verus ID and NFT Marketplace:** \nThe Verus ID and NFT marketplace is a decentralized platform where users can buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. This platform allows for peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries. Users can advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post their sale on the worldwide blockchain for everyone to see. Transactions can be executed using transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, which are still auditable by the user. The platform also allows owners to select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in the digital ownership economy.\n\n**Verus Vault:** \nVerus Vault is a security feature that allows users to protect their funds on a VerusID, even in the event of a private key theft. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the funds associated with that identity cannot be spent until it is unlocked again. However, users can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. Additionally, users can still receive funds while their VerusID is locked.\n\nIn summary, Verus offers a range of advanced features and capabilities that make it a powerful and versatile platform for creating complex blockchain ecosystems, decentralized marketplaces, and secure digital ownership solutions.",

While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.",
