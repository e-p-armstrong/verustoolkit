    "How do I create and launch a new currency on the Verus platform, and what are the key considerations and steps involved in this process?",
    "On the Verus platform, creating and launching a new currency involves several key steps. First, you need to have a VerusID, which is a unique identity on the platform. With a VerusID, you can define a new currency using the `definecurrency` command. This command requires specific parameters, such as the name of the currency, options, currencies it can be converted to, conversion ratios, and pre-allocation of funds.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to create a currency called \"gold\" that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold. You would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines the currency \"gold\" with specific options and conversion ratios. To launch the currency, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST and send the transaction returned from this command. This will initiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST pre-converted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\n\nOnce the currency is launched, you can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will park the conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either receive the converted amount of GOLD in your wallet or have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nSome key considerations when creating and launching a new currency on Verus include:\n\n* You need to have a VerusID to create a currency.\n* You can only create a currency with a unique name once.\n* The currency launch process involves mining, which earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch.\n* Currently, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option.\n\nOverall, creating and launching a new currency on Verus requires careful planning and execution, but offers a range of possibilities for creating new forms of value and utility on the platform.",
    " ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocation\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have m",
