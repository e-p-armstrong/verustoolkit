    "How do I create a raw transaction using the Verus command-line interface (CLI), and what is the importance of adapting the `createrawtransaction` command to ensure accurate transactions?",
    "To create a raw transaction using the Verus command-line interface (CLI), you need to use the `createrawtransaction` command. This command allows you to create a raw transaction that can be used to send Verus coins from one address to another.\n\nThe basic format of the `createrawtransaction` command is:\n```\nrun createrawtransaction '[{\"txid\": \"yourtxid here\", \"vout\": fill in too}]' '{\"destination addr\": <amount>}' <current Blockheight -5>\n```\nTo adapt this command for your specific transaction, you need to replace the following information:\n\n* `yourtxid here`: Replace this with the transaction ID (TXID) of the transaction you want to use as input.\n* `fill in too`: Replace this with the output index (VOUT) of the transaction you want to use as input.\n* `destination addr`: Replace this with the VerusID of the address you want to send the coins to.\n* `<amount>`: Replace this with the amount of Verus coins you want to send, minus the 0.0001 VRSC fee.\n* `<current Blockheight -5>`: Replace this with the current block height of the Verus blockchain, minus 5.\n\nFor example, if you want to send 2.20004763 VRSC from a transaction with TXID `fa5962ebf61ef31867ba73b173433841f8f68578d53b4bb30cfe1432b5820f15` and output index 10, to a VerusID `Oink@`, the command would be:\n```bash\nrun createrawtransaction '[{\"txid\": \"fa5962ebf61ef31867ba73b173433841f8f68578d53b4bb30cfe1432b5820f15\", \"vout\": 10}]' '{\"Oink@\": 2.20004763}' 890450\n```\nThis command will generate a long hexadecimal string, which represents the raw transaction. You need to copy this string and use it in the next step of your transaction.\n\nIt's important to note that you should never use the example data provided in the documentation, but instead use the results from your own wallet. This ensures that your transactions are accurate and secure.",
    "To create a raw transaction, we will need to use the CLI-interface. In Verus Desktop\n`run createrawtransaction '[{\"txid\": \"yourtxid here\", \"vout\": fill in too}]' \"{\"destination addr\": <amount>}\" <current Blockheight -5>`1. adapt the above `createrawtransaction` command, making sure to subtract the 0.0001 VRSC free from the amount that is in the original TXID, similar to this example:\n```bash\nrun createrawtransaction '[{\"txid\": \"fa5962ebf61ef31867ba73b173433841f8f68578d53b4bb30cfe1432b5820f15\", \"vout\": 10}]' '{\"Oink@\": 2.20004763}' 890450\n```\nIn this example, the result is a long HEX-string:\n```json\n0400008085202f8901150f82b53214fe0cb34b3bd57885f6f841384373b173ba6718f31ef6eb6259fa0a00000000feffffff019b011d0d0000000024050403000000cc1b04030001011504575dc6ae7484c83c0dc97a4218f88e2cbe9b659c7552960d006e960d000000000000000000000000\n```\nCopy the string that your command gave as response, from the CLI interface of your wallet. You will need it in the next step.note: The above command and its result are examples. ***DO NOT*** use data from it. Use the results from your own wallet!",
