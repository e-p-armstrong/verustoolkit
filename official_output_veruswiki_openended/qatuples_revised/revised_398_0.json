    "What are some of the additional capabilities of Verus, and how does Verus approach the testing and release of new features and networks?",
    "Verus is a powerful and versatile blockchain protocol that offers a range of advanced capabilities. Some of these capabilities include:\n\n* **On-chain launches of token, centralized currency, and liquidity basket AMMs**: Verus enables the creation and launch of new tokens, currencies, and liquidity basket automated market makers (AMMs) directly on the blockchain, without the need for external infrastructure or programming.\n* **On-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming**: Verus allows for the launch and merge mining of independent blockchains that can interoperate with each other, all without requiring any programming or technical expertise.\n* **On-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles**: Verus provides a platform for creating and managing self-sovereign, provable identities, as well as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and individual or organizational profiles, all on the blockchain.\n\nIn terms of testing and releasing new features and networks, Verus takes a careful and incremental approach. This involves running multiple testnet instances, with each instance serving as a proving ground for new features and capabilities before they are released on the mainnet. The testnets are typically run for a limited time, after which they are abandoned and replaced by new instances with updated features and capabilities. This approach allows Verus to thoroughly test and refine its technology before releasing it to the wider public.\n\nFor example, in the case of the PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) release, Verus will leave the current testnet running and fully functional while preparing the next release, which will include the final testnet instance before the mainnet PBaaS activation. This will allow users to test and familiarize themselves with the new features and capabilities before they are released on the mainnet.",
    "We will leave the current testnet running and fully functional, as we prepare the next release, which we expect to be ready for a mainnet PBaaS activation. We will effectively abandon this testnet and leave it running long enough to overlap with the next and final testnet instance before PBaaS release. You should be able to actually send currencies over from the first testnet to the second via Ethereum\u2019s Goerli testnet, even map some VRSCTEST-CLASSIC or something else through the bridge, but we do not intend to update that daemon again, or continue to run nodes or notaries on the old test network for more than a couple weeks after the new testnet goes live.Thanks for all your help and contributions, both already made and those to come for this historic upcoming release!### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles",
