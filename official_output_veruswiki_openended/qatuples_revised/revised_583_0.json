    "How can I determine whether a Verus coin was obtained through staking or mining?",
    "There are a few ways to determine whether a Verus coin was obtained through staking or mining, depending on the interface you are using.\n\n**Using the Command-Line Interface (CLI):**\nTo check if a coin was staked or mined using the CLI, follow these steps:\n\n1. Use the `listtransactions` command to view the last 10 transactions in your wallet.\n2. Copy the blockhash of the received award.\n3. Append the blockhash to the end of the Verus Explorer API URL (`https://explorer.verus.io/api/getblock?`) to view the block details.\n4. In the block details, look for the block type, which will indicate whether the coin was `mined` or `minted`.\n\n**Using Verus Desktop:**\nTo check if a coin was staked or mined using Verus Desktop, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the Mining Dashboard and enter the Verus details.\n2. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, where you will see a list of rewards labeled as either `mined` or `minted` in green.\n3. The TXIDs that staked the minted rewards will be shown in blue.\n\n**Using Verus Agama (Deprecated):**\nTo check if a coin was staked or mined using Verus Agama, follow these steps:\n\n1. Click on the magnifying glass icon next to the transaction.\n2. In the pop-up window, click on \"Open in the VRSC Explorer\" at the bottom left.\n3. In the VRSC Explorer, click on the block hash value (in light blue) to view the block details.\n4. Click on the info \"i\" icon on the right and then click on \"Search\" to view the block type, which will indicate whether the coin was `mined` or `minted`.\n\nRemember to always use the Verus Explorer to verify the block type, as this is the most reliable way to determine whether a coin was staked or mined.",
