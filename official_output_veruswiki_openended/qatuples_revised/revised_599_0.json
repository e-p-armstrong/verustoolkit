    "What are VerusIDs, and what are their key features and benefits in terms of identity applications, fund management, and decentralization?",
    "VerusIDs are a fully functional blockchain protocol that offers a range of features and benefits for identity applications, fund management, and decentralization.\n\n**Identity Applications:**\nVerusIDs provide opportunities for various identity applications, including quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network. This means that VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, with the added security of quantum resistance.\n\n**Fund Management:**\nVerusIDs allow for flexible fund management, as the controlling addresses or single or multi-sig properties can be changed by the controller of the identity. This change affects all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity, which will follow the updated spend conditions and be subject to the updated keys.\n\n**Decentralized Protocol:**\nVerusIDs operate on a fully decentralized protocol, which means that anyone can create one without needing permission. The costs of creating an ID are distributed to miners, stakers, and ID referrers, ensuring a decentralized and community-driven ecosystem.\n\n**Additional Benefits:**\nVerusIDs also offer additional benefits, such as the ability to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains. Furthermore, only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, and inherit funds in existing UTXOs, providing an added layer of security and control.\n\nOverall, VerusIDs provide a robust and decentralized solution for identity applications, fund management, and more, making them a powerful tool in the world of blockchain technology.",
    "# VerusID**VerusIDs** are a fully functional blockchain protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol, unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. Verus IDs are:",
