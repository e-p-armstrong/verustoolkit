    "When using the Verus Desktop and PBaaS chain, there are some important limitations and disclaimers to be aware of.\n\n**Limitation:**\nOne limitation to be aware of is that if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), you will not be able to use those same names for a PBaaS chain. However, this limitation is considered errata and will not be a limitation in the future.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\nThe software is experimental and unfinished, and users are warned to use it at their own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage that may occur.\n\n**Software License:**\nThe software is licensed under a permissive license that allows users to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software. The license also allows users to permit others to do the same.\n\n**Conditions:**\nThe license includes several conditions, including:\n\n* The enclosed copyright notice and permission notice must be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.\n* The software is provided \"as is\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied.\n* The authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use.\n\nIn summary, users should be aware of the limitations and disclaimers when using the Verus Desktop and PBaaS chain, and should understand the terms of the software license before using the software.",
