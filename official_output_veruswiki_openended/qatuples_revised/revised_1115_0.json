    "How can I use the `getimports` command to retrieve information about imports into a specific currency on the Verus network, and what are the optional arguments I can use to customize my query?",
    "The `getimports` command is a powerful tool in the Verus ecosystem that allows you to retrieve information about imports into a specific currency on the network. This command is useful for tracking the flow of assets into a particular currency, and can be customized to returns imports within a specific block range.\n\nThe basic syntax of the `getimports` command is as follows:\n```\ngetimports \"chainname\" (startheight) (endheight)\n```\nLet's break down the optional arguments you can use to customize your query:\n\n* `\"chainname\"`: This is the name of the chain you want to look for imports into. If you don't specify a chain name, the command will default to the current chain in the daemon.\n* `\"heightstart\"`: This is an optional integer argument that specifies the starting block height for your query. If you don't specify a starting height, the command will default to 0, which means it will return all imports from the genesis block onwards.\n* `\"heightend\"`: This is an optional integer argument that specifies the ending block height for your query. If you don't specify an ending height, the command will default to the maximum height of the blockchain, which means it will return all imports up to the current block height.\n\nBy using these optional arguments, you can customize your query to return imports within a specific block range. For example, if you want to retrieve all imports into a currency called \"MYCOIN\" between block heights 1000 and 2000, you would use the following command:\n```\ngetimports \"MYCOIN\" 1000 2000\n```\nThis command would return all imports into the \"MYCOIN\" currency that occurred between block heights 1000 and 2000.",
    "### `getimports \"chainname\" (startheight) (endheight)`\nReturns all imports into a specific currency, optionally that were imported between a specific block range.\n#### Arguments:\n```\n1. \"chainname\"           (string, optional) name of the chain to look for. no parameter returns current chain in daemon.\n2. \"heightstart\"          (int, optional)   default=0 only return exports at or above this height\n3. \"heightend\"           (int, optional)   default=maxheight only return exports below or at this height",
