    "What is Verus PBaaS Reserve technology, and how does it allow organizations to create their own currencies with independent blockchains, supported by world-class wallets and applications, while still being connected through the Verus Reserve protocol?",
    "Verus PBaaS Reserve technology is a decentralized protocol that enables organizations of any size to create their own currencies, each with its own independent blockchain. This technology allows these organizations to develop their own applications, support their currencies in world-class wallets, and use them for payments worldwide. The key feature of this technology is that it allows for seamless conversions between these independent currencies and a reserve currency, all without ever leaving the blockchain network.\n\nEach blockchain created using Verus PBaaS Reserve technology is independent, but they are all connected through the Verus Reserve protocol. This protocol enables the conversion of currencies between different blockchains, making it possible for organizations to use their own currencies for payments worldwide.\n\nTo create a new blockchain using Verus PBaaS Reserve technology, organizations need to define their chain using a command like the one shown in the example. This definition includes various parameters, such as the name of the chain, the payment address for the premine, the initial contribution, conversion rates, and the minimum and maximum amounts for pre-conversion. The example provided defines a chain that emits a premine to a specific address and converts all contributions up to a maximum amount to the native chain currency at launch at a 100%, 1:1 conversion price.\n\nThe Verus PBaaS Reserve technology also includes features such as notarization rewards, eras with rewards, decay, and halving, as well as node definitions with network addresses and payment addresses. This technology provides a flexible and decentralized way for organizations to create their own currencies and blockchain networks, while still being connected to a larger ecosystem.",

All contributions will enter the currency's reserve deposits, and the more contributions on this chain, the higher the starting reserve ratio will be. If the minimum contributions are not met, the chain will fail to start and all contributions can be spent back to the original contributors.",
