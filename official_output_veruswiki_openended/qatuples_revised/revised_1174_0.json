    "How does one launch a new currency on the Verus network, and what are the requirements and implications of doing so?",
    "Launching a new currency on the Verus network involves several steps and requirements. To initiate a currency launch, a user must first fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST. The launch process will start 50 blocks after the transaction is made, and the currency must have at least 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specific rate (in this case, 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch successfully.\n\nThis process is integrated into the mining process, where mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the miner a 0.025% conversion fee. This fee is paid in the form of VRSCTEST converted to the new currency (in this case, GOLD).\n\nBefore the launch, users can prepare for the launch by parking their conversions using a command like:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command effectively parks the conversion until the token launches. Once the token launches, the user will either receive the converted amount of the new currency (in this case, 0.975 GOLD) or have their original VRSCTEST returned.\n\nAfter the launch, creating new tokens requires a centralized issuance option. However, users can create new currencies that can be converted to with the newly launched currency (GOLD) or VRSCTEST. For example, creating a new currency called \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with GOLD or VRSCTEST would require a separate command.",
