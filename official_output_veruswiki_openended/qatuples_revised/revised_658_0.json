    "How do I set up pool-mining on a Linux system with low priority, using Verus mining software, to ensure that mining does not interfere with other processes running on my PC?",
    "To set up pool-mining on a Linux system with low priority, using Verus mining software, you'll need to follow a few steps. This setup is recommended for pool-mining, as it allows you to use CPU-heavy applications, like games, without the miner interfering.\n\n**Step 1: Download and Configure the Miner**\nFirst, you need to download the pool-mining software from the [Miners download page](https://verus.io/get-vrsc). Choose your preferred miner, extract it to your preferred location, and configure the batch file with the pool of your choice and your own mining address.\n\n**Step 2: Adjust the Batch File to Run on Low Priority**\nTo run the miner on low priority, you need to add `nice -n 19` to the command you normally use to run the miner. This will deprioritize the mining process, allowing your PC to use processing power for other tasks when needed.\n\n**Example for NHEQMINER:**\nFor NHEQMINER, you would run the command:\n```\nnice -n 19./nheqminer -v -l pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -p x -t 6\n```\nReplace `pool.verus.io:9999` with your preferred pool and `RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ` with your own mining address. The address shown is the VerusCoin foundation donation address. You can also change the identifier `Donator` to a name that easily identifies the miner to you.\n\n**Example for CCMINER:**\nThe process for CCMINER is similar, but the exact command may vary. Consult the CCMINER documentation for specific instructions.\n\nBy following these steps, you can set up pool-mining on a Linux system with low priority, ensuring that mining does not interfere with other processes running on your PC.",
    "# Linux pool-mining on low priority.Attention: Read it completely before use.### Links to VRSC miners:[Miners download page](https://verus.io/get-vrsc)## Procedure:In order to let your mining not interfere with other processes running on your PC, we'll need to deprioritize the mining process. This will result in your miner throttling down whenever your PC needs processing power. People have reported to be able to use CPU-heavy applications, like games, without the miner interfering, with this method.Because the Verus wallet (GUI and CLI) does a lot more than mining, it is not recommended to use this for a solo-mining setup. This is tested on Verus NHEQminer and Verus CCMiner on Ubuntu 18.04.First thing you will need is pool-mining software. The link is supplied above this procedure. Download your preferred miner, extract it to your prefered location and configure the batchfile with the pool of your choice and your own mining address.Now we'll need to adjust the batchfile to run on low priority:##### NHEQMINER:- Run your miner as you normally would, with `nice -n 19 ` placed in front of the command you normally use,\n  for example:\n   `nice -n 19 ./nheqminer -v -l pool.verus.io:9999 -u RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ.Donator -p x -t 6`\n - make sure you replace the pool (`pool.verus.io:9999`) with your prefered pool and the address\n  (`RVjvbZuqSGLGDm1B9BFkbHWySPKEx4tfjQ`) with your own address. The address shown in this line is the veruscoin\n  foundation donation address. If desired change the identifier (`Donator`) to a name that easily identifies the\n  miner to you.##### CCMINER:",
