    "What is Verus Vault, and how does it provide a decentralized solution to protect funds from theft or loss, and what are the steps to reset a testnet?",
    "Verus Vault is a decentralized solution that provides a new level of blockchain protection and funds recovery for VerusIDs, NFTs, and other assets. It allows users to lock their IDs, which can only be unlocked after a predetermined time delay, providing a decentralized solution to the infamous \"5 dollar wrench attack\". This means that even if an unauthorized person gains access to the primary keys, they will not be able to spend or access the funds immediately, giving the revocation and recovery authority identities time to intervene and recover the funds.\n\nIn addition to providing protection against theft or loss, Verus Vault also allows for time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance, ensuring that assets are preserved and transferred according to the owner's wishes.\n\nTo reset a testnet, you need to delete the following directories, depending on your operating system:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`\n* On Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`\n* On Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`, or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`\n\nAfter deleting these directories, you can restart the testnet daemon or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native.\n\nIt's also important to note that Verus Vault allows for exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain, which can be done using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```\nThis command exports an ID to a PBaaS chain, allowing for the transfer of assets between chains.",
    "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n  ```",
