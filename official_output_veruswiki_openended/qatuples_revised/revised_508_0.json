    "What new features and improvements have been added to the Verus network, and how do they enhance the user experience?",
    "The Verus network has undergone significant updates, addressing various issues and introducing new features to improve the overall user experience. One of the key updates is the testnet reset, which has resolved all reported issues related to PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID users.\n\nAnother exciting development is the support for the bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge, which enables seamless interactions between the Verus and Ethereum networks. This bridge has been thoroughly tested on private networks and is expected to launch soon.\n\nThe introduction of the `getvdxfid` RPC call is a significant addition, as it allows users to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys using their ID and published names. This feature has already been used to create self-sovereign, decentralized, and rent-free social media profiles, demonstrating the power of Verus as a platform.\n\nFurthermore, the Electron certificate issue in the GUI wallet has been fixed, resolving problems with price updates and BTC fee calculations. The support for additional popular ERC20 currencies has been added, anticipating increased usage with the release of the ETH bridge.\n\nThe GUI has also been improved, with a fix for calculated balances of specific addresses sometimes showing lower than actual, even though the wallet balance displayed correctly. Additionally, the network has undergone further hardening, fixes, and improvements focused on mainnet and the Ethereum bridge, ensuring a more robust and secure environment for users.\n\nOverall, these updates and features enhance the Verus user experience, providing a more robust, secure, and feature-rich platform for users to leverage and build upon.",
    "1. Testnet reset with fixes for all reported PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID user issues. If you had reported issues, please verify that the issues you reported are addressed in this release.\n2. Support for the bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge, which has been testing on private networks and which we hope to launch within a day or two after first vetting it on the release testing network with community test volunteers.\n3. Support for the new `getvdxfid` RPC call, used along with your ID and published names to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys, which community members used to create the world\u2019s first self-sovereign, completely decentralized, rent-free, non-cancelable social media profiles as can be seen here: https://luckpool.net/profile/identity/mike.vrsc . Work is underway to document the VDXF keys defined and used for profiles as well as the process of setting up your own. While the capability is already extremely powerful, we should remind everyone that Verus is a platform, not a social network. The core technology is exciting, but what will be even more exciting is when businesses and entrepreneurs leverage it to enable new, self-sovereign user experiences, applications, and accompanying businesses to enable the future, truly decentralized web.\n4. Fix for the Electron certificate issue in the GUI wallet, which has been affecting prices and preventing BTC fee calculation.\n5. Support for some additional, popular ERC20 currencies, in anticipation of more usage after release of the ETH bridge.\n6. Fix in GUI for calculated balances of specific addresses sometimes showing lower than actual, even though wallet balance displayed correctly.\n7. Additional hardening, fixes and improvement focused on mainnet and the Ethereum bridge.",
