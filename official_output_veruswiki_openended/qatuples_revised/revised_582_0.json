    "How does Verus DeFi protocol address the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, and what features does it offer for launching new blockchains and liquidity pools?",
    "The Verus DeFi protocol addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This provides a fair and transparent way for miners and stakers to earn fees, while also ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities.\n\nOne of the key features of Verus DeFi protocol is the ability to launch new blockchains and liquidity pools simultaneously. This allows for the creation of a fully decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. The bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset-backed or partially asset-backed currencies, and all fees generated via cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain.\n\nAnother important feature of Verus DeFi protocol is the ability to launch blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds. This allows creators to set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on-chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, and price-neutral carve-outs.\n\nIn summary, Verus DeFi protocol offers a robust and flexible solution for launching new blockchains and liquidity pools, while addressing the problems of MEV and front-running. Its features provide a fair and transparent way for miners and stakers to earn fees, and offer a range of options for creators to launch new currencies and blockchain-based projects.",
    "ies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100% backing. The Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners and stakers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n## Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches\n - Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n## Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)\n- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs",
