    "How do I disable login with the root user on a Linux system, especially when setting up a Verus node, to improve security?",
    "Disabling login with the root user is an important security step when setting up a Verus node on a Linux system. This is because the root user has unrestricted access to the system, and allowing remote access to the root user can pose a significant security risk.\n\nTo disable login with the root user, you will need to edit the SSH configuration file. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. **Open the SSH configuration file**: Use a command-line text editor like `nano` to open the SSH configuration file, usually located at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. You will need to use `sudo` to open the file, as it requires administrative privileges. The command would be `sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`.\n2. **Find the `PermitRootLogin` line**: In the file, find the line that says `PermitRootLogin yes`. This line allows root login, which is what we want to disable.\n3. **Change `PermitRootLogin` to `no`**: Change the `PermitRootLogin` line to `PermitRootLogin no`. This will disable root login.\n4. **Save and exit**: Save the changes to the file and exit the text editor.\n5. **Restart the SSH service**: To apply the new settings, you need to restart the SSH service. You can do this by running the command `sudo systemctl restart sshd`.\n\nIt's important to note that before you disable root login, you should make sure that you have a newly created user login that works and has `sudo` rights. This will ensure that you can still access the system as an administrator.\n\nBy following these steps, you can improve the security of your Verus node by disabling login with the root user.",
