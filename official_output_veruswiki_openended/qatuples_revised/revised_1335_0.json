    "What is Verus Vault, and how does it provide a decentralized solution to protect and recover funds, IDs, and NFTs from common forms of crypto loss or theft?",
    "Verus Vault is a decentralized security solution that provides an additional layer of protection for your funds, IDs, and NFTs on the Verus blockchain. It allows you to lock your VerusIDs, which can be revoked and recovered by designated revocation and recovery authority identities in case of an unauthorized unlock or access attempt. This mechanism provides a robust defense against common forms of crypto loss or theft, such as the \"5-dollar wrench attack\".\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nWhen you lock a VerusID using Verus Vault, you set a predetermined unlock time, which can be a specific duration, such as 24 hours. During this time, even if someone gains access to your primary keys, including a multisig of primary keys, they cannot spend or access the funds without first unlocking the ID and waiting for the unlock time to expire. Meanwhile, the revocation and recovery authority identities can still revoke and recover the ID, effectively circumventing the lock and preventing unauthorized access.\n\nVerus Vault not only protects your funds but also extends this security to your IDs and NFTs. Additionally, it enables time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance, providing a comprehensive solution for preserving generational blockchain wealth.\n\nIn essence, Verus Vault offers a decentralized solution to safeguard your assets, eliminating the need for traditional banking institutions. With Verus Vault, you can confidently store and manage your digital assets, knowing that they are protected from common forms of crypto loss or theft.",
    "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",
