    "How does Verus enable blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches and facilitate the creation of an interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale?",
    "Verus provides a platform for blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches and facilitates the creation of an interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale. Here's how:\n\n**Blockchain-based Crowdfunding Currency Launches:**\nVerus allows for blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge). This is achieved by setting required minimum levels of worldwide participation in preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees.\n\nThe launch options also provide for:\n\n* Maximum participation in one or more currencies\n* Pre-launch discounts\n* Price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies\n* Price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds\n* Pre-launch discounts for early participants\n* Vesting schedules in the pre-allocations using VerusIDs\n\n**Interoperable, Multichain Network:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. This is achieved through the use of Notary IDs, which are specified at chain definition and provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation.\n\nThe benefits of this network include:\n\n* Public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking\n* Private, internal blockchains that are easy to set up with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back\n* All features and currencies of the public chain are available, but with no external access\n* No limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network\n* Cross-notarization overhead is minimal, allowing for efficient and scalable operations\n\nOverall, Verus provides a powerful platform for blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches and facilitates the creation of an interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale.",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain networ",
