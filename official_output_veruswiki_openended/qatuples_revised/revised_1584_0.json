    "How can Verus Vault be used for time-locking, and what are some potential use cases for this technology? Additionally, how can I update an identity with a time lock or time delay, and what are some important considerations for using these features?",
    "Verus Vault is a powerful tool that can be used for time-locking, which allows users to set a specific block height or delay for unlocking an identity or funds. This technology has numerous potential use cases, including:\n\n* Providing time-locked funds to team members, children, or employees\n* Structuring time-locked deal and payment terms\n* Creating theft-resistant identities with delayed lock opening\n* Using time locks to add an extra layer of security to identity management\n\nTo update an identity with a time lock or time delay, you can use the `updateidentity` command with the `verus` executable. Here are some examples:\n\n* To set a time lock, which defines the unlock height of the identity, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n* To set a time delay, which defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state, you can use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\nSome important considerations when using these features include:\n\n* Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n* A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n* When using the `getcurrencyconverters` API, you can retrieve all currencies that meet certain liquidity thresholds, such as having at least 1000 VRSC in reserve and a reserve ratio greater than 10%.\n* When sending and converting currency, keep in mind that testnet coins and currencies have no value and will disappear whenever the testnet is reset.",
    "In addition to use cases related to theft resistance and delayed lock opening, Verus Vault can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms. The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.- **Time Lock:**\n  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- **Time Delay:**\n  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n  ```\n  Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.### Sending and Converting Currency\n**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**",
