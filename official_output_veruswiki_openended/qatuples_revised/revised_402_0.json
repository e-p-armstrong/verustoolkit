    "What is the process of launching a new currency on the Verus network, and how can you convert between different currencies once they are launched?",
    "To launch a new currency on the Verus network, you need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST and have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specific rate (in this example, 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch. This process is part of the mining process, and mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new currency.\n\nBefore the launch, you can park your conversion by sending a specific command, such as:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will effectively park your conversion until the token launches, at which point, you will either find the converted amount of the new currency in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nOnce a currency is launched, you can convert between different currencies using the `sendcurrency` command. For example, if you want to create a new currency called `mycoin` that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can create `mycoin` with a specific command that defines the currency's properties.\n\nIn general, the Verus network allows for the creation and conversion of different currencies, with a decentralized and secure process that rewards miners for their participation in the launch of new currencies.",
    "ncy must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
