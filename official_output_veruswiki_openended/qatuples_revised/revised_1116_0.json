    "How do I launch a new currency on the Verus blockchain, and what are the requirements for launching a new currency? Additionally, how can I convert between different currencies on the Verus blockchain?",
    "To launch a new currency on the Verus blockchain, you need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST and meet certain requirements. The launch process involves mining blocks, and the miners who participate in the launch process earn a 0.025% conversion fee. \n\nHere are the specific requirements for launching a new currency:\n\n1. **Funding requirement:** The currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST.\n2. **Preconversion requirement:** A minimum of 1000 VRSCTEST must be preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per unit of the new currency (in this example, GOLD).\n3. **Launch timing:** The currency launch will start 50 blocks after the transaction is made (this is the default setting).\n\nTo convert between different currencies on the Verus blockchain, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. For example, to convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will effectively park your conversion until the GOLD token launches. Once the token launches, you will either receive 0.975 GOLD in your wallet or have your VRSCTEST returned.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to create a new currency (e.g., `mycoin`) that can be converted to using either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can define the currency using the `definecurrency` command. The specifics of this command will depend on the properties and settings you want to define for your new currency.",
    "urrency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
