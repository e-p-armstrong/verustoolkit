    "How do I format Verus CLI commands on a Windows command line, and are there any differences in formatting between Windows and Linux/MacOS?",
    "When using the Verus CLI on a Windows command line, there are some specific formatting considerations to keep in mind. Unlike Linux and MacOS, the native Windows command prompt (`cmd.com`) requires different formatting for Verus CLI commands.\n\nTo format Verus CLI commands correctly on Windows, you need to substitute the characters used in the command format. Specifically:\n\n1. **Replace single quotes (`'`) with double quotes (`\"`)**: In the command format shown for Linux and MacOS, single quotes are used to enclose certain parameters. On Windows, you need to replace these single quotes with double quotes.\n2. **Replace double quotes (`\"`) with escaped double quotes (`\\\"`)**: Conversely, when you see double quotes in the command format, you need to replace them with escaped double quotes (i.e., `\\\"`) on Windows.\n\nIt's essential to note that these formatting adjustments only apply when using the native Windows command prompt (`cmd.com`). If you're using Verus Desktop, you can enter commands as listed without making any changes.\n\nBy following these simple formatting guidelines, you can ensure that your Verus CLI commands are executed correctly on a Windows command line.",
    "# Remarks on Windows command line formatting:\n\nThe CLI help shows the command format for Linux and MacOS. On the native windows command prompt (`cmd.com`) the formatting is different.\n\n* For windows substitute the shown `'`-character with the `\"`-character.\n * For windows substitute the shown `\"`-character with the `\\\"`-characters.\n\nNote: this only applies to giving commands from the windows command prompt. Verus Desktop will accept commands as listed.\n\nCreated by Oink.vrsc@\n\nNote: last revision date 2020-03-02.",
