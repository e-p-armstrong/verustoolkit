    "How do I reset my testnet environment for Verus?",
    "To reset your testnet environment for Verus, you need to take a few steps. First, make sure that Verus is closed and no testnet daemon is running. Then, you need to delete specific directories that store testnet data. The directories to delete vary depending on your operating system:\n\n* On Linux, delete `~/.komodo/vrsctest` and `~/.verustest`.\n* On Mac OS, delete `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest` and `~/Library/Application Support/VerusTest`.\n* On Windows 10, delete `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`, or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\` and `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`.\n\nAfter deleting these directories, restart the testnet daemon or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest, and re-add verustest native. This will reset your testnet environment, allowing you to start fresh.\n\nRemember to always ensure that Verus is closed and no testnet daemon is running before attempting to reset your testnet environment.",
