    "What are some of the key features of Verus Vault, and how can I use it for time locking and unlocking funds, as well as for conversion queries and sending currencies?",
    "Verus Vault is a powerful protocol capability that offers a range of features beyond traditional theft resistance and delayed lock opening. One of its key features is its ability to provide standard forms of time-locking, which can be used in various scenarios.\n\n**Time Locking:**\nVerus Vault allows you to time lock and unlock funds in a single operation, with the unlock period counting down immediately. This feature can be used to provide time-locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured to provide time-locked deal and payment terms. For example, you can use the `updateidentity` command to set a time lock on an identity, specifying the unlock block height:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n**Time Delay:**\nAdditionally, Verus Vault allows you to set a time delay for an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. This can be achieved by setting the `timelock` parameter to the desired block delay:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n**Conversion Queries:**\nVerus Vault also provides a feature for conversion queries, which allows you to retrieve all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. You can use the `getcurrencyconverters` API to achieve this, for example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nThis command will return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\n**Sending and Converting Currency:**\nFinally, Verus Vault allows you to send and convert currencies using the `sendcurrency` command. Note that all testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset.\n\nOverall, Verus Vault provides a powerful set of features for time locking, unlocking, conversion queries, and sending currencies, offering a range of possibilities for users to leverage this technology in innovative ways.",
    "In addition to use cases related to theft resistance and delayed lock opening, Verus Vault can be used to provide more standard forms of time-locking by simply time locking and unlocking in one operation, leaving the unlock period immediately counting down. This capability could be used to provide time locked funds to team members, children, employees, or structured in a way to provide time locked deal and payment terms. The uses for this technology are certainly beyond those that we have already thought of, and we look forward to seeing how people leverage this powerful new protocol capability.- **Time Lock:**\n  The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- **Time Delay:**\n  The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n  ```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n  ```\n  Will return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.### Sending and Converting Currency\n**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**",
