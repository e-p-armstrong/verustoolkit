    "What are the key benefits and features of VerusIDs, and how do they provide a secure and decentralized way to manage identities and funds on the Verus network?",
    "VerusIDs offer several key benefits and features that make them a secure and decentralized way to manage identities and funds on the Verus network. Here are some of the most important aspects of VerusIDs:\n\n**Quantum-ready Friendly Crypto-addresses:** VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, and are controlled by single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or properties are changed, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity will follow the updated spend conditions and be subject to the updated keys. Although VerusIDs are not currently quantum resistant for transactions, they are resistant to quantum attacks with known algorithms, and a quantum secure signature scheme is being integrated, which will allow for retroactive quantum resistance.\n\n**Fully Decentralized Protocol:** Anyone can create a VerusID and have complete, self-sovereign control over it without permission. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\n\n**Key Features of VerusIDs:**\n\n* **Revocable:** Each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and has the permission to revoke the identity, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.\n\nVerusIDs provide a secure and decentralized way to manage identities and funds on the Verus network, offering benefits such as quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses, full decentralization, revocability, and more.",
    "### Quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.0 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, VerusIDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers. VerusIDs are:- **Revocable** -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which defaults to the identity self, and which has the permission to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example, in the case of key theft.",
