    "Where are the files and data for Verus Desktop stored on a Linux system, and how can I access them?",
    "On a Linux system, the files and data for Verus Desktop are stored in various locations. \n\n**Program Folder:** \nWhen you run Verus Desktop on Linux, it is mounted to a temporary folder in the `/tmp` directory. This folder is named `.mount_Verus-xxxxx`, where `xxxxx` is a random set of characters that changes every time you start the wallet. This folder is hidden, so you need to press `<CTRL>-H` to toggle the display of hidden folders.\n\n**Daemons:** \nThe daemons for Verus Desktop, which are `komodod`, `verusd`, and `zcashd`, are located in the `resources/app/assets/bin/linux64` subfolder of the program folder.\n\n**Program Settings:** \nVerus Desktop saves its program settings in a separate folder, `~/.verus-desktop`. The user's settings are stored in `appdata/config.json` within this folder.\n\n**Chain Data and Wallet Locations:** \nThe chain data and wallet locations for different chains are as follows:\n\n* For KMD, the data is stored in `~/.komodo`.\n* For Verus, the data is stored in `~/.komodo/VRSC`.\n* For Komodo asset chains, the data is stored in subfolders of the KMD chain data and wallet folder, with standard names in capitals. For example, for Pirate, the data is stored in `~/.komodo/PIRATE`, and for Utrum, it's stored in `~/.komodo/OOT`.\n\n**Accessing Folders:** \nTo easily access the binary folders, Verus-Desktop program settings, and the VRSC chain folder, you can use the debug menu in Verus-Desktop.\n\nNote that changing files in these folders or subfolders may result in a corrupt installation, so only do so when instructed by the support community.",
    "# Standard file location for Verus Desktop\n\nThe Linux version of Verus Desktop is supplied as an AppImage, so it does not get installed, but mounted in the `/tmp` folder on execution.\nThe folder it is mounted to will look like `.mount_Verus-xxxxx` where the `xxxxx` part will be a random set of characters, changing on every start of the wallet.\n(It is a hidden folder: in order to see it, `<CTRL>-H` will toggle the display of hidden folders)\n\nNormally you don't need to worry about these locations, but in some instances you will be asked by community members providing support to look up a file in a folder in your Verus-Desktop installation.\n\nnote: changing files in these folders or subfolders may result in a corrupt installation. Only do so when instructed by our support community members.\n\n## Deamons\n\nThe daemons are located in the `komodod`, `verusd` and `zcashd` folders that can be found in the\n`resources/app/assets/bin/linux64` subfolder of your (mounted) program folder.\n\n## Program settings\n\nVerus Desktop saves it program settings on a different folder:\n`~/.verus-desktop`\nThe users settings are stored in `appdata/config.json` in the program settings folder.\n\n## Standard chain data and wallet locations\n\n#### KMD\n\n`~/.komodo`\n\n### Verus\n\n`~/.komodo/VRSC`\n\n#### Komodo asset chains\nAny Komodo asset chain will create a subfolder in the KMD chain data and wallet folder, which is standard named. The names will be in capitals and are identical to the **official** asset-chain name.\n`~/.komodo/<CHAIN-NAME>`\n\nNote: examples\nPirate: `~/.komodo/PIRATE`\nUtrum: `~/.komodo/OOT`\nZexo: `~/.komodo/ZEXO`\nAnd so on...\n\nFor easy access to the binaries folders, Verus-Desktop program settings and VRSC chain folder and all binary folders, you can use the debug menu in Verus-Desktop.\n\nnote: created at 2020-12-03 by Oink.vrsc@",
