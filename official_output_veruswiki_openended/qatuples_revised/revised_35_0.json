    "How do I define and launch a new currency on the Verus platform, and what are the requirements for a successful launch?",
    "To define and launch a new currency on the Verus platform, you need to follow a series of steps. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:\n\n**Defining the Currency:**\nFirst, you need to define the currency using the `definecurrency` command. For example, let's say you want to define a currency called \"gold\". You would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency called \"gold\" with specific properties, such as the conversion rate to VRSCTEST, the minimum amount required for conversion, and the pre-allocation of funds to a specific identity.\n\n**Funding the Currency Identity:**\nBefore launching the currency, you need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST. This is a requirement for launching a new currency.\n\n**Launching the Currency:**\nTo launch the currency, you need to send a transaction to the network with the currency definition. The launch will start 50 blocks from when the transaction is made, and it requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be pre-converted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch. The mining process will earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD.\n\n**Converting VRSCTEST to GOLD:**\nAfter the currency is launched, you can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will park your conversion until the token launches, and you will either receive 0.975 GOLD in your wallet or have your VRSCTEST returned.\n\n**Creating a New Currency:**\nIf you want to create a new currency that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can use the `definecurrency` command again with the new currency's properties. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency called \"mycoin\" with specific properties, such as the conversion rates to VRSCTEST and GOLD, and the initial supply of the currency.\n\nOverall, launching a new currency on the Verus platform requires careful planning and execution, but it offers a lot of flexibility and customization options for creating new tokens with unique properties.",
    "s, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
