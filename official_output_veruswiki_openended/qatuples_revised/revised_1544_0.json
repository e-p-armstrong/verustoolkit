    "How do I verify the authenticity of a Verus download, and what are some key features that have been added to the Verus Mainnet Protocol through recent upgrades?",
    "To verify the authenticity of a Verus download, you can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands provided by the Verus CLI. \n\n**Verifying a Download:**\nWhen you download a Verus package, it comes with a.txt file that includes the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. This package has been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\". To verify the download, follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive.\n2. Verify the signature for the extracted archive using the extracted.txt file.\n3. Extract the archive to your desired directory.\n\n**CLI Examples:**\nYou can verify the file directly using the `verifyfile` command:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AR1XEAABQR8XbEix6eohYN9m6BbLjcdUkCZH/NYw1/mfBq/mIT6SewPg4PvaJHsUIO8FLB8kQDpa9eKglWJN9DTfvpWlMH9Z /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.0-4-amd64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.7.0-4-amd64.tar.gz\n```\nAlternatively, you can verify using a checksum with the `verifyhash` command:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AR1XEAABQR8XbEix6eohYN9m6BbLjcdUkCZH/NYw1/mfBq/mIT6SewPg4PvaJHsUIO8FLB8kQDpa9eKglWJN9DTfvpWlMH9Z 3c8134361c965ab87751f817a097c1825ca61e2a521bfd1ed9382fbc44638920\n```\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.\n\n**Recent Upgrades to Verus Mainnet Protocol:**\nThe Verus Mainnet Protocol has undergone significant upgrades, including the activation of new features such as:\n\n* Support for season 4 Komodo notary node operators\n* The removal of the requirement for coinbase shielding on past coinbases that have not yet been shielded\n* The ability to use IDs for storing and staking funds, enabling full use of IDs for staking and mining rewards\n\nThese upgrades have enhanced the functionality and security of the Verus Mainnet Protocol.",
    "## Verifying Downloads\nA txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, is included for each download.

In addition, a couple of user features, including restoring \"-pubkey=hexpubkey\" as a parameter for redirecting staking and mining rewards are included.## The network upgrade activated the following features:\n- Added support for season 4 Komodo notary node operators- Coinbase shielding will no longer be required on any coinbases from the past that have not yet been shielded.- Staking will now work on all normal ID balances, enabling full use of IDs for storing and staking funds.",
