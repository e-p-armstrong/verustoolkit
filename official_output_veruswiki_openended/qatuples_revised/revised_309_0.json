    "What are the key features and upgrades included in the Verus ID and VerusHash 2.1 Network Upgrade, and how do they improve the security and functionality of the Verus network?",
    "The Verus ID and VerusHash 2.1 Network Upgrade is a significant update to the Verus network that introduces two major technological advancements. The first upgrade is an improvement to the FPGA-equalizing hash algorithm, which enhances the security and efficiency of the network. The second upgrade is the introduction of Verus ID, a revolutionary decentralized identity technology that provides a secure, quantum-ready, and fully decentralized self-sovereign digital identity system.\n\nVerus ID is a game-changer in the world of digital identities, as it integrates zk-SNARKs to provide built-in privacy at its core. This means that users can maintain complete control over their personal data and identity, without relying on centralized systems or intermediaries. Verus ID also improves blockchain address security, making it more secure and resistant to attacks.\n\nThe Verus ID system is designed to be decentralized and self-sovereign, meaning that users have full control over their identity and data. This is a significant departure from traditional centralized identity systems, which often compromise user privacy and security. With Verus ID, users can enjoy a high level of security, privacy, and control over their digital identity.\n\nThe Verus ID and VerusHash 2.1 Network Upgrade is a significant milestone in the development of the Verus network, and it has the potential to disrupt traditional centralized identity systems. While it is still in the testing phase, the upgrade is expected to bring significant benefits to the Verus community and beyond.",

It is considered fully ready for testing on both VRSCTEST testnet and VRSC mainnet. While this release is likely to work fine on mainnet through the coming activation, it is not yet an official release that you should expect to support mainnet activation. If you install this version, please make sure to upgrade to an official release before network activation, which will happen at block 800200, expected to be mined or staked on December 15th.\nThis release enables two technology upgrades, one that would be considered big news to most cryptocurrency projects, an improvement to the FPGA-equalizing hash algorithm, and a revolutionary, new decentralized identity technology, Verus IDs, that will disrupt today\u2019s centralized systems with the most secure, quantum ready, fully decentralized, self-sovereign digital identity system in the world.\n## Verus ID\nVerus ID includes built-in privacy at the core through integration of zk-SNARKs, and provides a revolutionary improvement to blockchain address security, ma",
