    "How does Verus support the launch of new blockchains, including simultaneous blockchain and liquidity pool launches, crowdfunding currency launches, and interoperable multichain networks?",
    "Verus provides a range of features to support the launch of new blockchains, including simultaneous blockchain and liquidity pool launches, crowdfunding currency launches, and interoperable multichain networks.\n\n**Simultaneous Blockchain and Liquidity Pool Launches:**\nVerus allows for the launch of a new blockchain alongside a decentralized or centralized \"bridge\" converter liquidity pool. This liquidity pool is bound to the new blockchain and runs on it, generating fees that are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This provides a seamless connectivity between the two blockchains.\n\n**Crowdfunding Currency Launches:**\nVerus supports crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds. This means that you can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. Additionally, launch options provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n\n**Interoperable Multichain Network:**\nVerus enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking. This multichain network allows for unlimited scale and new use cases, making it possible to create a wide range of blockchain applications and use cases.",
    "ols.\n### Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches\n- Launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain. Bridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed currencies, but is bound to the launch of the new blockchain, runs on the new blockchain, and all fees generated via cross chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain, only seamless connectivity.\n### Blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge)\n- Set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in your preferred currencies on chain. If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n### An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as",
