    "What are the new parameters `-arbitragecurrencies` and `-arbitrageaddress` in Verus, and how do they contribute to the upcoming \"auto-arbitrage\" feature?",
    "The new parameters `-arbitragecurrencies` and `-arbitrageaddress` in Verus are currently being tested and will be part of the upcoming \"auto-arbitrage\" feature. This feature will combine decentralized on-chain marketplace offers for currency with liquidity basket import processing, providing miners and stakers with the opportunity to commit funds from their node wallet in common currencies to spot and leverage guaranteed arbitrage opportunities when making a block.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* Miners and stakers will be able to capture guaranteed arbitrage opportunities and arbitrage with any currency they choose from their wallets.\n* Blockchain users will be able to set limit orders and have them filled if they are near the market price for a currency, or if the market moves in their direction.\n* Liquidity providers (LPs) and users of liquidity baskets for conversion will get as close to market prices as possible on their conversions, never releasing funds from a basket before an on-chain, MEV-resistant auction takes place for the pricing of those assets.\n\nThe \"auto-arbitrage\" feature will provide a win-win situation for all participants, as it will allow miners and stakers to earn from arbitrage opportunities, while also providing liquidity to the market and benefiting blockchain users and LPs. Although the feature is not yet available, it is an exciting development that will enhance the functionality of the Verus protocol.",
    "v0.9.6 also includes support for new parameters `-arbitragecurrencies=[\u201cVRSCTEST\u201d,\u201dvETH\u201d]` and `-arbitrageaddress=valid R-address, pubkey, or ID`. They\u2019re exciting, but don\u2019t try to use them just yet. They are for testing right now, and are preparing for an \u201cauto-arbitrage\u201d feature already supported in the protocol, but which we hope to have in the daemon before mainnet PBaaS activation that combines decentralized on-chain marketplace offers for currency with liquidity basket import processing to provide miners and stakers the opportunity to commit some amount of funds from their node wallet in common currencies to spot and leverage guaranteed arbitrage opportunities when making a block. These opportunities arise between orders on chain and liquidity basket pricing that if leveraged to earn, actually result in P2P crowdsourcing of liquidity for all baskets across the network, both from the blockchain itself as well as miners and stakers, while benefiting all participants in the following ways:\n- Miners and stakers can capture guaranteed arbitrage opportunities and arbitrage with any currency that they choose from their wallets.\n- Blockchain users can set limit orders and have them filled if they are near the market price for a currency, or if the market moves in their direction.\n- LPs and users of liquidity baskets for conversion get as close to market prices as possible on their conversions, never releasing funds from a basket before an on-chain, MEV-resistant auction takes place for the pricing of those assets.Although this release is likely to be robust enough for a mainnet, we have come this far with quality and will not rush for a few days earlier upgrade. We still plan to review and complete a small number of hardening items before PBaaS 1.0 is ready for its mainnet release.",
