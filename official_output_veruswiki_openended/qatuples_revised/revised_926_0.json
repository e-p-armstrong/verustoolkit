    "How does Verus support the creation and management of new blockchain-based currencies and networks, and what features does it offer for launching and operating these currencies and networks?",
    "Verus provides a robust framework for creating and managing new blockchain-based currencies and networks. When a new blockchain is launched on the Verus network, all fees generated through cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent going back to the Verus blockchain. This allows for seamless connectivity between the new blockchain and the Verus network.\n\nOne key feature of Verus is its support for blockchain-based, crowdfunding currency launches. This allows for minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge). Users can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on the chain, and if these minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, less network fees.\n\nVerus also offers a range of launch options, including:\n\n* Maximum participation in one or more currencies\n* Pre-launch discounts\n* Price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies\n* Price-neutral carve-outs of proceeds\n* Pre-launch discounts for early participants\n* Vesting schedules in pre-allocations using VerusIDs\n\nIn addition, Verus enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains. These private blockchains are easy to set up and allow for easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access.\n\nOverall, Verus provides a flexible and scalable platform for creating and managing new blockchain-based currencies and networks, with a range of features and options to support successful launches and operations.",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain networ",
