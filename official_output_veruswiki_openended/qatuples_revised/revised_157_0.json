    "What kind of warranty and liability does Verus software come with, and what should I do if my antivirus software flags the Verus software as malicious?",
    "The Verus software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty or guarantee, express or implied. This means that the authors and copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software. This includes, but is not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n\nRegarding antivirus software flagging Verus as malicious, it's not uncommon for antivirus software to flag mining software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because some third-party installations of mining software may be used to exploit users' computers. However, in the case of Verus, these warnings are false positives.\n\nIf your antivirus software flags Verus as malicious, you can review resources from reputable sources such as Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to understand why this is happening. These resources explain that certain antivirus software may flag mining software as malicious, even if it's legitimate and not harmful.\n\nAdditionally, Verus provides links to VirusTotal, a website that scans software for viruses and malware, to show that the software is clean and safe to use. You can check these links to verify the safety of the Verus software for yourself.",
