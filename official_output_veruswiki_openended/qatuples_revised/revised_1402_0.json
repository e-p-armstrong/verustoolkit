    "What happens to my wallet balances when syncing my Verus wallet, and why might they not reflect an accurate balance until the sync is complete?",
    "When you are syncing your Verus wallet, your balances may adjust as the chain syncs. This is because the wallet can only account for transactions that have occurred in the blocks it has received and scanned. As new blocks are scanned, your balance will continue to adjust. This means that your wallet balance may not reflect an accurate balance until you are fully synced. \n\nThe time it takes to complete the sync process depends on the number of addresses in your wallet and how far along you are in re-syncing. In some cases, this may take several minutes to complete. \n\nIt's essential to understand that your wallet balance is not finalized until the sync is complete. During the syncing process, your balance may fluctuate as new blocks are scanned and added to your wallet. Once the sync is complete, your wallet balance will reflect an accurate representation of your holdings.",
