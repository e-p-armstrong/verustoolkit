    "How do identities work in Verus, and what are the implications of transferring an identity?",
    "In Verus, identities are a critical component of the blockchain ecosystem. An identity is a type of digital entity that can own and manage assets, execute transactions, and interact with other identities. Each identity has three authorities associated with it: the primary authority, revocation authority, and recovery authority.\n\n**Primary Authority:**\nThe primary authority is the entity that controls the identity and can execute transactions on its behalf. It is the primary address associated with the identity and is responsible for managing the identity's assets.\n\n**Revocation Authority:**\nThe revocation authority has the power to revoke the primary identity, effectively freezing all associated assets and transactions. However, it cannot spend funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n\n**Recovery Authority:**\nThe recovery authority can recover a revoked identity, but it cannot modify an unrevoked identity or change the revocation authority.\n\n**Transferability:**\nIdentities are transferable, meaning that the primary authority can be changed by updating the identity with a new primary address controlled by another party. This transfer may or may not modify the revocation and recovery authorities, depending on the circumstances.\n\n**Implications of Transfer:**\nWhen an identity is transferred, all associated assets and transactions are also transferred to the new controlling party. This change is automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the identity using the `z_getbalance identity@` command.\n\n**Future-Proofing:**\nOne of the benefits of Verus identities is their ability to adapt to future advancements in cryptography and blockchain technology. If a new address type or signature algorithm, such as a quantum-secure algorithm, is added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an updated identity will be subject to the new spend conditions. This means that existing transactions can be retroactively secured with more advanced security protocols, providing an added layer of protection for identity holders.",
    "y except its name, its parent, which is derived from the blockchain on which it is defined, and unless it is also one of the two other authorities, it may not modify any data under their control, including the identity of the other authorities once specified.\n  - **Revocation** - this identity may revoke the primary identity, which will also revoke access to all funds and transactions under its control, but it may not spend any funds or sign on behalf of the identity.\n  - **Recovery** - this authority may redefine/recover a revoked identity, but it may not change the revocation authority, nor may it modify an unrevoked identity at all.\n3. Identities are transferable by defining them with primary addresses with private keys, which are under another party\u2019s control. When identities are transferred, the revocation and recovery authorities may or may not be modified as well, as long as the party updating the ID has the authority to do so.\n4. If an identity is transferred from one party to another, all funds in transactions that are under the control of that identity will also transfer to the party to which control is being transferred. In the native wallet, these changes are automatically reflected in the wallet balance and visibility of the balance of an identity using `z_getbalance identity@\u201d`.\n5. If later, a new address type or signature algorithm, such as one that is quantum secure s added to the Verus blockchain, all transactions sent to an identity that is updated to be under the control of the new address type will be subject to its spend conditions as well. That means that if you have 1000 transactions sent to your identity name/address, an upgrade to a quantum secure address, when they are available, will retroactively secure all 1000 transactions under the control of that address.",
