    "How do I launch a new token on the Verus network, and what are the requirements for launching a token? Additionally, how do I convert VRSCTEST to a new token after it launches, and how do I create a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST?",
    "Launching a new token on the Verus network involves several steps and requirements. Firstly, the address initiating the token launch must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST. The token launch is initiated by sending a transaction that includes the token's launch parameters, such as the conversion rate and the amount of VRSCTEST required to launch the token. In this case, the token launch requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD.\n\nOnce the token is launched, the only way to create new tokens is through a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to the new token, you can use the `sendcurrency` command, specifying the address, the token to convert to, and the amount to convert. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis command will park the conversion until the token launches, and then convert the specified amount of VRSCTEST to GOLD at the specified rate.\n\nTo create a new token that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can use the `definecurrency` command, specifying the token's properties, such as its name, options, currencies, and conversion rates. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nThis command defines a new token called \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with either VRSCTEST or GOLD. The token's properties, such as its name, options, and conversion rates, are specified in the JSON object passed to the `definecurrency` command.",
    "ncy must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
