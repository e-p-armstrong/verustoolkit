    "How can I estimate my profitability from staking Verus coins, including predicting the number of blocks I can expect to get on average from PoS, determining when the next halving will occur, and tracking the unlocking of timelocked coins?",
    "To estimate your profitability from staking Verus coins, you can use a staking calculator, such as the one available on GitHub. This calculator allows you to input your current block height and the amount of coins you are staking, and it will provide you with an estimate of your average block reward from PoS.\n\nAdditionally, the calculator will show you when the next halving will occur, as well as the block reward and duration of the halving period. It will also provide you with an estimate of the number of timelocked coins that have been unlocked and are mature.\n\nTo get a more accurate estimate, you can also enter a percentage for guessing how many coins are actually staking, and compare it to your own actual average. This will give you an idea of your percentage of total coins possible to stake, and you can track how your position holds up over time.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Verus Desktop uses live information from the blockchain to provide real-time predictions of your profitability on your staking balance. This includes data on locked coins, coins in z-addresses, current coinsupply, minimum stake age of UTXOs, and staking difficulty.\n\nBy using these tools, you can get a better understanding of your profitability from staking Verus coins and make informed decisions about your staking strategy.",
    "Question 1: I have x amount of mature coins in my public address. How many blocks can I expect to get on average from PoS?\nQuestion 2: When is next halving, what is the block reward, and how long will it last?\nQuestion 3: How many timelocked coins have been unlocked and are mature?\n\nAnswer:\nhttps://github.com/Oink70/Staking-calculator/releases\n\nDownload this spreadsheet and keep it handy to input current blockheight and amount of coins you are staking when you want to know.\nYou can also enter a percentage for guessing how many coins are actually staking, to see when it matches your own actual average.\nSee your own percentage of total coins possible to stake, and pay attention to the number day to day, to see how your position holds up.\nThe spreadsheet will also show how many days until the next halvings.\nThe calculation of timelocked coins being unlocked is based on an average for the entire period, but should be fairly accurate, and is included in the total of staking coins.\n\nnote: Verus Desktop uses the live info from the blockchain with regards to locked coins, coins in z-addresses, current coinsupply, minimum stake age of UTXOs and staking difficulty to display real-time predictions of your profitability on your staking balance.\n\n(submitted by Cragorn.vrsc@, additions by Oink.vrsc@)\n\nnote: last revision date 2020-04-30.",
