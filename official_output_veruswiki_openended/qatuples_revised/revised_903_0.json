    "What are the steps to create a new Verus identity, and how does the name commitment and registration process work to prevent name \"front running\"?",
    "Creating a new Verus identity involves two main steps: committing to a name and registering the identity. The purpose of this process is to prevent \"name front running,\" where a miner could potentially replace your purchase of an ID with their own purchase of the same name.\n\n**Step 1: Committing to a Name**\nThe first step is to commit to a unique and friendly name that you want to associate with your identity. This name is unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has the name you want, you'll need to either be the first to purchase it from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization. When you commit to a name, it's kept secret until you register it and reveal your commitment.\n\n**Step 2: Registering the Identity**\nThe second step is to register your identity, which requires paying a fee of 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the fee is reduced to 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity using the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money is automatically spent along with your registration.\n\n**Preventing Name \"Front Running\"**\nThe name commitment and registration process is designed to prevent \"name front running,\" where a miner could potentially replace your purchase of an ID with their own purchase of the same name. By committing to a name first and then registering it, you ensure that your name is secured and cannot be replaced by someone else.\n\n**Benefits of Having a Verus Identity**\nOnce you have a Verus identity, you can use a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash to send money or perform other actions. This makes it easier to interact with the Verus blockchain and other users.",
    "## Making a new identity\nArguably, the hardest part of the new Verus identity technology is just making your first identity, especially without a GUI. Once you have your own identity, a lot becomes easier, not the least of which is the ability to send money to a friendly name instead of a base58 blockchain address or hash. For example, once you have your identity, either of the following commands will work as well as just about any other CLI command that takes an address:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST z_sendmany bob@ \u2018[{\u201caddress\u201d:\u201dalice@\u201d, \u201camount\u201d:100}]\u2019\n```\nor\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendtoaddress alice@ 100\n```\nMaking a Verus ID requires two steps, steps that are designed to prevent potentially selfish miners from replacing your purchase of an ID from the Verus blockchain with their own purchase of the same name instead. To prevent this name \u201cfront running\u201d, you must first commit to a name that you wish to have in your identity as its friendly name. Friendly names are unique to a blockchain, so if someone already has a specific name you must have, you will need to either be the first to purchase that name from the blockchain or acquire it from the controlling individual or organization.Creating a name commitment registers your commitment, but keeps the name completely secret until you register it and reveal your commitment. When you register a name, you must pay 100 VRSC or 100 VRSCTEST, unless you have a referral from someone who already has an identity. With a referral, the price is 80 VRSC or 80 VRSCTEST. When you register an identity with the CLI wallet, the correct amount of money, 100 VRSC without and 80 VRSC with a referral is automatically spent along with your registration. The funds for a referral are distributed as follows:",
