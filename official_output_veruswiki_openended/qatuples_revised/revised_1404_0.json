    "What are the fees associated with conversions on the Verus network, and how does the platform facilitate the launch of new currencies?",
    "On the Verus network, there is a fee of 0.025% for conversions, which is distributed entirely to miners and stakers. Additionally, an implied volatility fee is planned to be implemented in the future, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions. This fee will ensure that blocks that significantly change the price of a currency pay more, and that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers with earnings from implied volatility fees.\n\nRegarding the launch of new currencies, Verus provides a unique and innovative approach. The platform allows for currency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate, or automatic refunds if the minimums are not met. The launch process also features dynamic pricing based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations. All of these features are specified through easy-to-understand commands and parameters, eliminating the need for programming knowledge.\n\nFurthermore, currencies can be launched to accept a range of other currencies, with or without fractional reserve capabilities. The Verus import/export protocol is designed to make integration with other blockchains provable and easy, and external bridges are being developed to enable automatic send/receive of any Verus network token between Verus and ETH/ERC20 tokens. This means that currencies can be sent between Verus and ETH, expressed as Verus currencies on the Verus network, and exposed automatically on ETH as an ERC20 token.",
    "There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.# The Best Way to Launch a Currency\nCurrency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!Currencies can be launched to accept a range of other currencies and with or without fractional reserve capabilities.
