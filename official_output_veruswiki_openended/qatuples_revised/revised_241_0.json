    "How do I sign transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus testnet and mainnet, and what are the capabilities of the new Verus testnet?",
    "Signing transactions from multi-signature IDs on the Verus testnet and mainnet involves a few steps. First, you need to create a transaction and get the raw transaction data using the `sendcurrency` command. For example:\n```\nverus sendcurrency <multi-signature-ID>@ '[{\"address\":\"<destination_address>\",\"amount\":<transaction_amount>}]'\n```\nNext, you need to get the operation ID returned by the `sendcurrency` command and use it to get the raw hex transaction data using the `z_getoperationstatus` command:\n```\nverus z_getoperationstatus <operation_id_returned_by_sendcurrency>\n```\nThen, you need to take the raw hex transaction data to each additional wallet containing the additional signing addresses/IDs and sign it using the `signrawtransaction` command:\n```\nverus signrawtransaction <raw_hex_transaction>\n```\nAfter the last necessary signature is applied, you can broadcast the transaction on the network using the `sendrawtransaction` command:\n```\nverus sendrawtransaction <raw_hex_signed_transaction>\n```\nThe new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform that offers a wide range of capabilities. With the Verus testnet, you can create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains without any programming. You can perform basic operations using a GUI or more advanced functions using the command line. The Verus testnet allows you to send currencies worldwide on the same chain or across blockchains with ease, and even convert currencies to others on the network without an exchange by sending to yourself and converting along the way. The Verus testnet is accessible from the released versions of Verus Desktop and Verus CLI wallets, and it offers unlimited possibilities for decentralized applications, businesses, governments, projects, and individuals.",
