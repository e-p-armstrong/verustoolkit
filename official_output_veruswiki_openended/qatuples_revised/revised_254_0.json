    "How does Verus ID improve upon traditional blockchain identity systems, and what advantages does it offer?",
    "Verus ID is a blockchain identity technology that addresses the fundamental issues of traditional blockchain systems, such as the risk of losing access to cryptocurrency assets due to lost keys. Unlike traditional systems, where the loss of keys means the loss of funds, Verus ID provides a solution that ensures users have full control over their funds and blockchain assets while minimizing the risk of loss.\n\nVerus ID achieves this through the use of self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable identities. These identities are quantum-ready friendly, meaning they are resistant to attacks by quantum computers using known algorithms. Here are some key advantages of Verus ID:\n\n1. **Unified Identity and Currency Address**: With Verus ID, your friendly name can be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer. This means that your identity and currency address are one and the same, making it easier to manage your funds and online presence.\n\n2. **Multi-Signature Security**: Each identity must have a set of addresses (one or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity. This adds an extra layer of security to your funds, as multiple signatures are required to authorize transactions.\n\n3. **Authority and Governance**: Each identity refers to two additional identities that have authority over the primary identity. The primary identity is the self-identity and may modify any part of the identity. This allows for flexible governance and management of your online presence and funds.\n\nIn summary, Verus ID provides a robust and secure identity management system that combines the benefits of decentralization, censorship resistance, and quantum readiness with the convenience of a unified identity and currency address.",
    "# Verus ID - A Better Blockchain Identity Technology\nIf you\u2019ve been around crypto for even a little while, you\u2019ll start to hear things like \u201cnot your keys, not your coins\u201d, \u201close your keys, lose your coins\u201d. If you lose your keys, no one will ever be able to recover your money.In fact, trading off decentralized, censorship resistant public systems for this risk to your cryptocurrency assets is such a fundamental issue in blockchain systems today that it is considered an acceptable price for having the benefit of full control over your own funds and blockchain assets.Verus ID provides an elegant solution to these previously unsolved, fundamental problems, and also provides quantum-ready friendly identity names and blockchain funds addresses as self-sovereign, revocable, recoverable identities that provide the following advantages over today\u2019s blockchain systems:1. Identity and currency address are one and the same. Your friendly name can be used as both a reference to who you are and an on-chain destination for any funds transfer.\n2. Each identity must have a set of addresses (1 or more) and a minimum number of signatures required from those addresses to spend or sign on behalf of an identity. Each identity also refers to two additional identities that have authority over:\n  - **Primary** - this is the self identity and may modify any part of the identit",
