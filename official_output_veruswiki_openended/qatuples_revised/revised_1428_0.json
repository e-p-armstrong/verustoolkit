    "How does the Verus protocol prevent front-running and ensure fair currency conversions, and what features does it offer for launching new currencies?",
    "The Verus protocol prevents front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions within a group of transactions are processed at the same rate, without any spread between the conversion to and from a currency. This means that all transactions are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions, resulting in the same price for each direction.\n\nTo achieve this, Verus uses a mechanism called \"aggregation of import blocks\", where all transactions are grouped together and solved simultaneously. This ensures that everyone involved in the conversion gets the same price, regardless of the direction of the conversion.\n\nIn addition to this, Verus charges a fee of 0.025% for conversions, which goes entirely to miners and stakers. To further mitigate risks, Verus also plans to introduce an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions. This fee will be higher for blocks that significantly change the price of a currency, and lower for those that are less volatile. This mechanism ensures that liquidity providers are rewarded for taking on the risk of impermanent loss, and that the risk is offset by earnings from implied volatility fees.\n\nWhen it comes to launching new currencies, Verus offers a range of features to ensure a fair and successful launch. These include:\n\n* Kickstarter-like minimums to activate, which automatically refund if not met\n* Dynamic currency launch pricing based on participation\n* Pre-launch participation price discounts\n* Pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts\n* Price-neutral launch pre-allocations\n\nAll of these features are designed to be easy to use and understand, with no programming necessary. They provide a robust and flexible framework for launching new currencies, and help to ensure that the launch process is fair, transparent, and successful.",
    "# An end to front running\nConversion will always be at the same rate as all conversions processed in one group of transactions. There is also no spread between the conversion to and from a currency. All transactions in a aggregation of import blocks, which will be detailed in later documentation, are simultaneously solved in all currency conversion directions and all converted at the same rate, all getting the same price in each direction as any person who may be exchanging in the other.There is a fee, 0.025% for conversions, 100% of which goes to miners and stakers. While it is not yet implemented, we also intend to add an implied volatility fee, which will be charged variably on imbalanced blocks of transactions, making blocks that change the price of a currency significantly pay more of an implied volatility fee, and ensuring that relatively volatile currency baskets offset any potential impermanent loss to liquidity providers risk with earnings from implied volatility fees. At the same time, currency baskets that are less volatile relative to the constituent currencies will typically have lower implied volatility fees and lower earnings for liquidity providers to offset a lower risk of impermanent loss.# The Best Way to Launch a Currency\nCurrency launches with Kickstarter-like minimums to activate or, if not met, automatically refund, dynamic currency launch pricing, based on participation, pre-launch participation price discounts, pre-conversion reserve currency carveouts, and price-neutral launch pre-allocations, all specified in easy to understand commands and parameters, no programming necessary!",
