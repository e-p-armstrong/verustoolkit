    "What are some key features and capabilities of the Verus network, including the use of internal blockchains, locking and unlocking IDs, and conversion queries?",
    "The Verus network is a powerful and flexible platform that offers several key features and capabilities. \n\n**Internal Blockchains:**\nOne of the notable features of the Verus network is the ability to create private, internal blockchains that can be easily set up and bridged with public currencies. This allows organizations to have their own private networks with all the features and currencies of the public chain, but without the need to expose their internal operations to the public. There is no limit to the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate on the Verus network, making it a highly scalable and versatile platform.\n\n**Locking and Unlocking IDs:**\nAnother important feature of the Verus network is the ability to lock and unlock IDs. This can be done using the `updateidentity` command, which allows users to set a timelock parameter that defines the unlock height of the identity. There are two types of locks: time locks, which define the unlock height of the identity, and time delays, which define how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state. It's important to note that revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height, and a locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n\n**Conversion Queries:**\nThe Verus network also provides a powerful API called `getcurrencyconverters` that allows users to retrieve all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves. This API can be used to find currencies that have specific markets at or above a certain liquidity threshold. For example, the command `verus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth` will return all currencies that have BTC/ETH markets at or above the liquidity threshold.\n\nOverall, the Verus network offers a wide range of features and capabilities that make it a powerful and flexible platform for building and operating blockchains. Its ability to support internal blockchains, lock and unlock IDs, and perform conversion queries make it an attractive option for organizations and individuals looking to build and deploy their own blockchain-based applications.",
    " well as private, internal blockchains, which are easy to setup with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network. While there is some overhead for cross notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is fractal, enabling an unlimited number of simultaneously operating, interoperable blockchains.\n#### Locking and Unlocking IDs\n- **Time Lock:**\n The timelock parameter defines the unlock height of the identity.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 0, \"timelock\": <Unlock block height>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- **Time Delay:**\n The timelock parameter defines how many blocks to delay an ID's unlock when the flags are set back to an unlocked state.\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST updateidentity '{\"name\": \"ID@\", \"flags\": 2, \"timelock\": <Unlock block delay>, \"minimumsignatures\": 1, \"primaryaddresses\": [\"t-address\"]}'\n```\n- Revoking an identity will clear its locked status, regardless of time delay or unlock height.\n- A locked identity cannot revoke itself.\n### Conversion Queries\nThe `getcurrencyconverters` API retrieves all currencies that have at least 1000 VRSC in reserve, are greater than 10% VRSC reserve ratio, and have all listed currencies as reserves\n- **E.g. BTC ETH:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST getcurrencyconverters btc eth\n```\nWill return all currencies that have btc/eth markets at or above the liquidity threshold.",
