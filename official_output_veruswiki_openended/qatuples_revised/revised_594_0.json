    "What are the recommended and absolute minimum system requirements for running a Verus wallet, staking, solo mining, and pool mining, and what are the key components needed for each?",
    "To run a Verus wallet, stake, solo mine, or pool mine, you need to meet certain system requirements. Here's a breakdown of the recommended and absolute minimum requirements for each:\n\n**Running a Verus Wallet:**\n\n* Recommended: 64-bit processor with AES functions enabled, 64-bit operating system with GUI interface, 8 GB memory or more + 6 GB Swap available to the CLI Wallet, 50 GB storage on a fast medium (like NVMe device) for the Verus Blockchain & CLI wallet, internet connectivity, and `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries installed.\n* Absolute minimum: Not specified, but it's implied that the recommended requirements are the minimum needed to run a wallet.\n\n**Staking:**\n\n* Recommended: All requirements to run a wallet, a fully configured and functioning NTP client to keep your clock synchronized, and low latency internet connectivity.\n* Absolute minimum: All requirements to run a wallet.\n\n**Solo Mining:**\n\n* Recommended: All requirements to run a wallet, 64-bit processor with AES functions enabled, and low latency internet connectivity.\n* Absolute minimum: All requirements to run a wallet.\n\n**Pool Mining:**\n\n* Recommended: 64-bit processor with AES functions enabled, 64-bit operating system, ARM release of CCMiner or NHEQminer, low latency internet connectivity, a public address to mine to, and a public mining pool to connect to.\n* Absolute minimum: Not specified, but it's implied that the recommended requirements are the minimum needed to pool mine.\n\nIn summary, to participate in the Verus ecosystem, you need a 64-bit processor and operating system, sufficient memory and storage, and a reliable internet connection. Additionally, for staking and solo mining, you need a properly configured NTP client and low latency internet connectivity. For pool mining, you need specific mining software and a public mining pool to connect to.",
