    "What are the terms and conditions of using Verus software, and how should I interpret warnings from antivirus software such as Avast and Kaspersky?",
    "The Verus software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty, express or implied. This means that the authors and copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liabilities arising from the use of the software.\n\nIt is essential to understand that antivirus software such as Avast and Kaspersky may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). These warnings are not necessarily indicating that the software is malicious, but rather that it is mining software, which could be installed by a third party to exploit your PC.\n\nTo clarify, these warnings are false positives, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these warnings. Please note that these resources are external and not provided here.\n\nIn summary, when using Verus software, you should be aware of the terms and conditions, which include no warranty and no liability for any damages. Additionally, you should not be alarmed by warnings from antivirus software, as they are likely false positives due to the software's mining capabilities.",
