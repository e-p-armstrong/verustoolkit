    "What are the terms and conditions of using Verus software, and what should I know about potential false positive warnings from antivirus software?",
    "When using Verus software, it is essential to understand the terms and conditions of its use. The software is provided \"as is,\" without any warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.\n\nIn addition to these terms and conditions, you should be aware that some antivirus software may flag Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is not because the software is malicious, but rather because it is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. Avast and Kaspersky are two examples of antivirus software that may issue such warnings.\n\nIt's important to understand that these warnings are false positives, and Verus software is not malicious. You can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these false positives and why they occur. These resources explain that PUP warnings are issued when software has the potential to be used for malicious purposes, even if it is not inherently malicious.\n\nTo verify the safety of Verus software, you can check the VirusTotal detection results for the software on different platforms, including MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows. These results show that the software is not detected as malicious by most antivirus engines.",
