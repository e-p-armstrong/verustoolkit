    "To import your Lite wallet address into your native Verus Desktop wallet, you need to follow a few steps. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you through the process:\n\n**Prerequisites:**\nBefore you start, make sure you have a running native wallet that is fully synchronized. The earliest wallet that supports these functions is Verus Desktop v0.6.4-beta-1 or later. If you need help synchronizing your wallet, you can refer to the wallet's synchronization guide.\n\n**Converting Seed to WIF:**\nIf you have a seed phrase, you can retrieve your Private key (WIF) by having the Verus Desktop wallet convert it for you. Here's how:\n\n1. Open your Verus Desktop wallet and go to `Settings` -> `Coin Settings`.\n2. Select the chain you want to use in the top-right corner.\n3. Enter the following command:\n```\nrun convertpassphrase \"word_1 word_2 word_3... word_n\"\n```\n**Important:** Replace `word_1 word_2 word_3... word_n` with the actual seed phrase (12 or 24 words) of the address you want to import.\n\n**Importing the Address:**\nOnce you have your Private key (WIF), you can import your Lite wallet address into your native Verus Desktop wallet.\n\n**Note:** When using `verus command \"<userinput>\"`, make sure to replace `<userinput>` with your specific user data, including the `<` and `>` symbols. For example, if you're asked to enter a Public Address, replace `<Public Address>` with the actual address, like `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`.",
    "# How to import your Lite wallet address into your native Verus Desktop?Attention: Read it completely before using.### Important General Information`verus command \"<userinput>\"` needs to be entered literally, with `<userinput>` replaced by your specific userdata. So if the text directs you to use for example `\"<Public Address>\"`, you replace that (including the `<` and `>`) with the address,\nso it looks similar to this: `\"RYX6RYU3AAvwVCNyNM4cVyGUhSMUPvKs3r\"`.This method is confirmed to work on Verus and all Komodo assetchains.## PrerequisitesIn order to convert your seedphrase into a Private key (WIF), you need to have a running native wallet first, that is fully synchronized.
