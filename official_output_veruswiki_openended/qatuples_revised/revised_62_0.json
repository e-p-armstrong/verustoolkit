    "How do decentralized and centralized currencies on the Verus platform handle ID registration, including payment options, referral structures, and the impact on currency supply and value?",
    "On the Verus platform, both decentralized and centralized currencies can issue IDs using their own currency as the payment currency. This process can be done in a decentralized or centralized manner, depending on the type of currency.\n\n**Decentralized Fractional Currencies:**\nFor fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, which reduces the supply and raises the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves. This means that the cost of ID registration is tied to the value of the fractional currency itself. The minimum price of ID registration can be set in either the fractional currency or one of its reserves, such as USDC or DAI. Additionally, more than the minimum price can be paid for ID registration, which may also include VDXF key and contract bindings to allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.\n\n**Centralized Currencies:**\nFor centralized currencies, ID registration can be sold using the currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, and permission from the currency identity required. This means that the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity, or even referrals required, which means that an identity registration must have a referral and co-signature of a referring ID that is either the currency ID or another ID from that currency namespace.\n\n**Referral Structure:**\nBoth decentralized and centralized currencies can have multiple levels of referral support, up to a limit of 5 levels. This means that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred, and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies, or be sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.\n\nIn summary, the Verus platform provides a flexible and decentralized way for currencies to issue IDs, with options for payment, referrals, and permission control. This allows for a more decentralized and community-driven approach to ID registration, while also providing incentives for referrals and reducing the supply of fractional currencies.",
    "All fractional and centralized {\u201cproofprotocol\u201d:2} currencies can now issue as a decentralized operation, or with centralized currencies, sell, IDs using their own currency as the payment currency, with options for price, referrals, permission from the currency identity required, which means the transaction must be created or co-signed by the currency identity, or even referrals required, which means that an identity registration must have a referral and co-signature of a referring ID that is either the currency ID or another ID from that currency namespace.\nFor fully decentralized fractional currencies, ID registration is paid for by burning the specific fractional currency, reducing the supply, and raising the on-chain value of the primary currency relative to its reserves by reducing the current on-chain supply for everyone.\nThe minimum price of ID registration for fractional currencies can be set in either the fractional currency itself, or in one of its reserves, for example USDC or DAI.\nMore than the minimum price can be paid for ID registration, which may also include VDXF key and contract bindings to allow for multiple types of content or IP licensing in a single ID namespace.\nEach currency, either centralized and/or fractional, can have multiple levels of referral support (limit of 5 levels), meaning that the ID registration fee will be reduced when referred and part of it will be divided evenly among past referrers. The remaining amount of the ID registration fee will be burned for decentralized currencies, or be sent to the currency ID for centralized currencies.",
