    "What are some common issues that may arise when downloading and installing Verus software, and how can I verify the authenticity of the downloads?",
    "When downloading and installing Verus software, you may encounter issues related to antivirus software flagging the installation as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is a false positive warning, indicating that the installation includes mining software, which could potentially be used to exploit your computer if installed by a third party.\n\nTo alleviate concerns about the authenticity of Verus downloads, each download package includes a `.txt` file containing the signer, standard SHA256 file checksum, and signature. These packages are signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\".\n\nTo verify the authenticity of a download, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Extract the downloaded archive**: Unzip or extract the contents of the downloaded file.\n2. **Verify the signature for the extracted archive**: Use the extracted `.txt` file to verify the signature of the archive using the `verus verifyfile` command. For example:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AQVqGwABQR/OeunkOwu/sRpFtHBBU33MD6DkvkFnM8vpFTBmNQF1m3eAtOyetX0LuTcUxjuc1KMX/vj15Y54e0OSwzYWtLAA /Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.0-2-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.0-2-x86_64.tar.gz\n```\nAlternatively, you can **verify using a checksum** by using the `verus verifyhash` command:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" AQVqGwABQR/OeunkOwu/sRpFtHBBU33MD6DkvkFnM8vpFTBmNQF1m3eAtOyetX0LuTcUxjuc1KMX/vj15Y54e0OSwzYWtLAA c814ca39dae00ca2152ab01ed3bd6b4a10e5d0b10320677f08686fb15c9bd126\n```\nIf the signature is valid, the result will be `true`.",
