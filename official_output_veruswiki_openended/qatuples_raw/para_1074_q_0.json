    "How do I create a currency on the Verus network, and what are some examples of how I can use this feature to launch a trusted and auditable store of value?",
    "To create a currency on the Verus network, you need to have an ID of the same name as the currency you want to create. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. This means that if you want to create a currency called \"gold\", you need to have an ID called \"gold@\".\n\nLet's take an example of how you can use this feature to launch a trusted and auditable store of value. Suppose you have three IDs: \"gold@\", \"mycoin@\", and \"mike@\". You want to create a currency called \"gold@\" that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold. This means that you want to create a currency that is trusted by the community and can be verified to be backed by a real store of gold.\n\nTo achieve this, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Create an ID called \"gold@\" and ensure that you are the controller of this ID.\n2. Define the properties of the \"gold@\" currency, such as its name, symbol, and initial supply.\n3. Launch the \"gold@\" currency on the Verus network, which will create a new blockchain for the currency.\n4. Verify that the \"gold@\" currency is backed by a real store of gold, for example, by partnering with a gold vault or a reputable gold dealer.\n5. Make the verification process transparent and auditable, so that the community can trust that the \"gold@\" currency is indeed backed by a real store of gold.\n\nAnother example is creating a token called \"mycoin@\", which can be used for a Kickstarter-like campaign. In this case, you would follow similar steps to create the \"mycoin@\" currency, but with different properties and use cases.\n\nOverall, the Verus network provides a flexible and decentralized platform for creating and managing currencies, allowing you to launch trusted and auditable stores of value that can be used for a variety of purposes.",
    "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"",
