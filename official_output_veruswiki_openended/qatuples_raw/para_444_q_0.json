    "What are the additional capabilities of the Verus platform, and how does the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace enable decentralized transactions and proven digital ownership?",
    "The Verus platform offers several additional capabilities that enable users to create and utilize decentralized applications and use cases. Some of these capabilities include:\n\n* On-chain launches of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs, which allows for the creation and deployment of new digital assets and financial instruments on the Verus blockchain.\n* On-chain launches and merge mining of independent, connected, interoperable blockchains without programming, which enables the creation of new blockchains and decentralized applications without requiring extensive coding knowledge.\n* On-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles, which provides users with a secure and decentralized way to manage their digital identities and assets.\n\nThe Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a key component of the Verus platform, enabling users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs in a completely decentralized manner. This marketplace allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all to see. Transactions can be executed directly, peer-to-peer, without the need for intermediaries, and payments can be made from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, which are still auditable by the user.\n\nOne of the key benefits of the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is that it enables owners to select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. This creates a new paradigm for digital ownership, where users have full control over their assets and can monetize them in a decentralized and secure way.\n\nOverall, the Verus platform and its ID and NFT Marketplace provide a powerful toolset for creating and utilizing decentralized applications and use cases, and enable a new level of digital ownership and control for users.",
    "As always, we do not promise, we describe a vision and welcome contributors from everywhere. Now that we, as a community, have delivered on the original phases of the vision together, it is time for all of us to consider what we might want to build over this incredible, geoscale, ID-enabled, fully decentralized platform. Our next efforts across the community should be to realize the promise of this network in the use cases we create, use cases that we will have an advantage creating on Verus over any other platform because it really is that much better.### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see.
