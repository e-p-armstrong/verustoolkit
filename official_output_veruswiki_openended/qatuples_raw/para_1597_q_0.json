    "What are some examples of how to use the `verus` command-line tool to retrieve currency statistics and perform specific actions, such as refunding contributions to a failed PBaaS chain launch?",
    "The `verus` command-line tool provides several options for retrieving currency statistics and performing specific actions. Here are a few examples:\n\n**Retrieving Currency Statistics:**\nTo get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block, you can use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate\n```\nIf you want to retrieve currency statistics for a specific block, you can specify the block number:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum\n```\nAlternatively, you can retrieve currency statistics for a range of blocks with a specific period between them:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```\n**Refunding Contributions to a Failed PBaaS Chain Launch:**\nIf a PBaaS chain launch fails, you can refund contributions using the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME\n```\nNote that this command is specific to the `VRSCTEST` chain and requires the name of the failed chain as an argument.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:**\nIt's important to note that the `verus` software is experimental and unfinished, and use of it is at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage, and the software is provided \"as is\" without any implied or express warranties. Additionally, this is a test release intended for testing and development with public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), and it has not been tested for use on mainnet.",
