    "How does Verus handle the creation of new currencies and the relationship between currency names and IDs?",
    "In Verus, creating a new currency requires a specific ID with the same name as the currency. The controller of this ID has the exclusive ability to create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once. This means that if you want to create a currency called \"gold\", you need to have an ID named \"gold@\" and be its controller.\n\nLet's break down an example to illustrate this process. Suppose you have three IDs: \"gold@\", \"mycoin@\", and \"mike@\". If you want to create a currency called \"gold@\", you need to be the controller of the \"gold@\" ID. Once you create the currency, it will be associated with the \"gold@\" ID.\n\nThe Verus platform allows for a high degree of flexibility and customization when creating new currencies. For instance, you could create a currency like \"gold@\" that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold, providing a trusted and transparent way to represent gold ownership.\n\nSimilarly, you could create a token like \"mycoin@\" that is designed to function like a Kickstarter, where a business can raise funds by issuing tokens to investors. The possibilities are endless, and the Verus platform provides the tools and infrastructure to support a wide range of use cases.\n\nIt's worth noting that the relationship between currency names and IDs is a critical aspect of the Verus platform. By requiring a specific ID to create a currency with a corresponding name, Verus ensures that currency names are unique and cannot be duplicated. This helps to prevent confusion and ensures that users can trust the integrity of the currencies they interact with on the platform.",
    "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a busines",
