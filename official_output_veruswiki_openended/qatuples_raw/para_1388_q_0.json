    "What are the key features and benefits of Verus multi-currency fractional reserve baskets, and how do they work?",
    "Verus multi-currency fractional reserve baskets are UTXO-based, fractional reserve currencies that offer several innovative features and benefits. These baskets are designed to provide a provably fair liquidity system for all currencies and tokens within the PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) system.\n\nOne of the key features of Verus multi-currency fractional reserve baskets is anti-front running, which helps to prevent unfair advantages in trading and ensures a level playing field for all users. Additionally, the system solves liquidity issues simultaneously and in a provably fair manner, making it a reliable and trustworthy solution for users.\n\nIn terms of how they work, Verus multi-currency fractional reserve baskets use a new \"sendcurrency\" API that allows for the conversion of one currency to another, including fractional currencies where the source currency is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency. This API includes parameters such as \"currency\" and \"convertto\", which specify the source currency and the currency to convert to, respectively.\n\nFor example, on the Verus Testnet, the default currency name is \"vrsctest\", and users can specify the source currency and the currency to convert to using the \"sendcurrency\" API. This feature enables users to easily convert between different currencies and take advantage of the benefits offered by the Verus multi-currency fractional reserve baskets.\n\nOverall, Verus multi-currency fractional reserve baskets offer a powerful and flexible solution for users who need to work with multiple currencies and tokens within the PBaaS system.",

It contains fixes necessary to continue participating in the testnet launched in v0.7.1-1 and 0.7.1-2, without reset of your wallet or holdings, if you started using the VRSCTEST multi-currency testnet in v0.7.1-1 or \"-2\". You should be able to synchronize easily, but if you are unable to synchronize VRSCTEST shortly after connecting, try deleting the data in your VRSCTEST folder, and retain the wallet.dat file.\n- Improved staking supply calculation# Verus Testnet with Multi-currency Fractional Reserves and Currency Launch Protocol\nVerus multi-currency fractional reserve baskets are UTXO-based, fractional reserve currencies with anti-front running, simultaneously solved, provably fair liquidity system for all currencies and tokens in or imported into the PBaaS system.While Verus daemon v0.7.1-3 has minor improvements for mainnet operation, it offers full support for the new Verus Testnet multi-currency technology preview. On testnet, the new \"sendcurrency\" API, which is already available on Verus mainnet in its simplified form, is enhanced with new multi-currency parameters. The first parameter, \"currency\":\"currencyname\" - where the default on testnet for currency name is \"vrsctest\", specifies the source currency of the send. The next, \"convertto\":\"currencyname\", allows conversion from one currency to either a fractional currency where it is a reserve or a reserve of the fractional currency of the source.",
