    "What are the benefits of Verus' merge mining and multi-chain technology, and how can I send and convert currencies on the Verus network using the `sendcurrency` API?",
    "Verus' merge mining and multi-chain technology enables Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash. This means that all network blockchains can provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens as well as native zk-SNARK supporting currencies. This technology allows for earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously.\n\nIn addition to this powerful technology, Verus provides a `sendcurrency` API that allows users to send and convert funds on the Verus network. Here are some examples of how to use the `sendcurrency` API:\n\n* **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address to a single recipient:** You can use the following command to send VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n\n* **Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to multiple recipients:** You can use the following command to send VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to multiple recipients (alice@ and bob@):\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n\n* **Converting VRSCTEST to another currency:** You can use the following command to convert VRSCTEST to another currency, TESTCOIN:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"TESTCOIN\"}]'\n```\n\n* **Preconverting to a new currency before it is active:** You can use the following command to preconvert VRSCTEST to a new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:\n\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\n\nTo create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.",
    "# Preparing for Multi-chain, Dynamic Merge Mining\nWhile this 0.7.1 testnet enables on-chain token currency definition, the same advances will soon be available on the Verus merge mining and multi-chain technology which was running on testnet last year. When enabled, this will make it possible for Verus network chains to operate fully independently, yet be dynamically merge mineable along with Verus and up to 20 other Verus network blockchains on a single hash, earning rewards and powering all chains simultaneously. All network blockchains will provide the same fractional currency capabilities, both for on-chain tokens as well as native zk-SNARK supporting currencies as well.## Sending and Converting Currency\n**Warning: All testnet coins/currencies have no value and will disappear whenever VRSCTEST is reset**The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.\n**Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Converting VRSCTEST to another currency, TESTCOIN:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"TESTCOIN\"}]'\n```\n**Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```## Defining a CurrencyTo create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name.
