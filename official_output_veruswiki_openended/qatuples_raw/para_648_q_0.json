    "How can I create a currency with a specific name on the Verus platform, and what are the requirements for doing so?",
    "On the Verus platform, creating a currency with a specific name requires that you have an ID with the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once. This ensures that each currency has a unique name and prevents naming conflicts.\n\nFor example, let's say you have three IDs: `gold@`, `mycoin@`, and `mike@`. If you want to create a currency called `gold@`, you need to have control of the `gold@` ID. Similarly, to create a currency called `mycoin@`, you need to have control of the `mycoin@` ID.\n\nWhen creating a currency, you can choose to launch it in a way that maps it to a specific, auditable store of value, such as a gold reserve. This can help establish trust in the currency and provide a level of transparency and accountability.\n\nAdditionally, you can create a token like `mycoin@` that functions like a Kickstarter, where a business or project can raise funds by issuing tokens to investors. This can be a powerful tool for crowdfunding and community-driven projects.\n\nOverall, the Verus platform provides a flexible and secure way to create and manage currencies, with built-in features to ensure transparency, accountability, and trust.",

I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business,",
