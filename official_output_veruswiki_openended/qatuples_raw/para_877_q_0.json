    "How can I use the `sendcurrency` API in Verus to send and convert funds between different addresses and currencies, and what are some examples of how to use this API for different use cases?",
    "The `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert funds between different addresses and currencies. Here are some examples of how to use this API for different use cases:\n\n**Sending Funds between Addresses:**\nYou can use the `sendcurrency` API to send funds from one address to another. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from an address `bob@` to an address `alice@`, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nYou can also send funds from all private wallet funds to multiple recipients by using the `*Z` wildcard and specifying the friendly-name z-addresses of the recipients. For example:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*Z\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@:private\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@:private\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Converting Funds between Currencies:**\nThe `sendcurrency` API also allows you to convert funds from one currency to another. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency called VRSC-BTC, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*i\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nYou can also convert funds from one reserve currency to another through a fractional currency. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to BTC through the VRSC-BTC fractional currency, you can use the following command:\n```json\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\n**Preconverting Funds:**\nAdditionally, the `sendcurrency` API allows you to preconvert funds to a new currency before it launches. This can be useful for preparing for upcoming token launches or other events that may affect the value of your funds.\n\nOverall, the `sendcurrency` API provides a flexible and powerful way to manage your funds and convert between different currencies and addresses in the Verus ecosystem.",
