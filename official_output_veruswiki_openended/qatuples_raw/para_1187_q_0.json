    "How can I park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches, and later create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST?",
    "To park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches, you can use the `sendcurrency` command. This command allows you to effectively park your conversion until the new token launches. When the token launches, you will either find the converted amount of the new token in your wallet, or you will have your original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nHere's an example of how to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token called `gold`:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"your_address@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command tells Verus to convert 100 VRSCTEST to GOLD when GOLD launches. If GOLD launches, you will either find 0.975 GOLD in your wallet (based on the conversion rate), or you will have your 100 VRSCTEST back.\n\nLater, if you want to create a new token called `mycoin` that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, you can define `mycoin` using the `definecurrency` command. This command allows you to specify the properties of `mycoin`, including the currencies it can be converted to.\n\nHere's an example of how to define `mycoin`:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\n\nThis command defines `mycoin` as a new token that can be converted to with either VRSCTEST or GOLD. The `options` field is a configurable integer, `proofprotocol` is set to PROOF_CHAINID, `currencies` lists the currencies that can be converted to `mycoin`, `minpreconversion` specifies the minimum amounts of VRSCTEST and GOLD needed to convert to `mycoin`, and `initialsupply` sets the initial supply of `mycoin` to 20,000 units.\n\nBy using these two commands, you can park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token before it launches, and later create a new token that can be converted to with either the new token or VRSCTEST.",
    "dcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
