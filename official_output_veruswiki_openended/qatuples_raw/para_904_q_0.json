    "What are some important limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency features in Verus, and what does the disclaimer at the end of the text imply about the state of the software?",
    "When working with multi-currency features in Verus, there are a few limitations to keep in mind.\n\nFirstly, it is not recommended to create an ID with an i-address as its actual name, rather than its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. This could lead to problems whenever an i-address or name may be used, and is not supported for creating currencies.\n\nSecondly, if you are using the Verus Desktop GUI, you will not be able to use the names of supported currencies, such as BTC or ETH, as a PBaaS chain. This is a limitation in the current testnet release, but will not be a limitation in future releases.\n\nThe disclaimer at the end of the text implies that the software is still in an experimental and unfinished state. It warns users that they use the software at their own risk, and that there is no warranty for any kind of damage. This means that users should be cautious when using the software and should not rely on it for critical or production use cases.\n\nOn the other hand, the permission notice grants users the right to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software freely, as long as they include the copyright notice and permission notice in all copies or substantial portions of the software. This implies that the software is open-source and that the developers are willing to allow users to contribute to and modify the software.",
    "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!
