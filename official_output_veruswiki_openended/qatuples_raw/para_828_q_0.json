    "How does Verus Vault provide a decentralized solution to protect and recover funds from unauthorized access, and what features does it offer beyond just fund protection?",
    "Verus Vault provides a decentralized solution to protect and recover funds from unauthorized access by utilizing a combination of locked VerusIDs, revocation and recovery authority identities, and time locks. Here's how it works:\n\nWhen a VerusID is locked, it can only be spent or accessed after a predetermined unlock time has passed. However, the revocation and recovery authority identities can always revoke and recover the VerusID, circumventing the lock. This means that if an unauthorized unlock occurs, the revocation authority can quickly revoke and recover the VerusID, preventing any unauthorized access to the funds.\n\nThis feature provides a decentralized solution to the infamous \"5 dollar wrench attack\", where an attacker uses physical coercion to gain access to a victim's private keys. By setting a time delay on the unlock, such as 24 hours, the owner of the VerusID has time to respond to any unauthorized unlock attempts and prevent any loss of funds.\n\nBeyond just fund protection, Verus Vault offers a range of features that provide a new level of blockchain security and decentralized recovery for IDs and NFTs. These features include:\n\n* Time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance.\n* Protection and recovery of IDs and NFTs, not just funds.\n* A decentralized solution that does not rely on a central authority, such as a bank.\n\nOverall, Verus Vault provides a robust and decentralized solution for protecting and recovering funds, IDs, and NFTs from unauthorized access, while also offering a range of features that go beyond just fund protection.",
    "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",
