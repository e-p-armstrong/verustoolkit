    "How do I verify the authenticity and integrity of Verus downloads, and what are the key security updates in version 0.9.9-2?",
    "Verifying the authenticity and integrity of Verus downloads is crucial to ensure that you are using a genuine and secure version of the software. To do this, you can follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Extract the downloaded archive**\nAfter downloading the Verus package, extract the archive to a folder on your system.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the signature using the extracted text file**\nIn the extracted folder, you will find a text file that contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature. This file is used to verify the authenticity of the download. You can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands in the Verus CLI to verify the signature.\n\n**Example using `verifyfile` command**\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"signature_hash\" \"/path/to/downloaded/file.tar.gz\"\n```\n**Example using `verifyhash` command**\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"signature_hash\" \"file_checksum\"\n```\nIf the signature is valid, the command will return `true`.\n\n**Security Updates in Version 0.9.9-2**\nVersion 0.9.9-2 of Verus includes several critical security updates that address vulnerabilities in the software. The key updates include:\n\n* **Mitigation for Rab13s vulnerability**: This update fixes a zero-day vulnerability that could allow attackers to target specific nodes and exhaust their resources. The fix is adapted from a similar fix implemented in Zcash and also improves privacy while gossiping transactions around the network.\n* **Update of OpenSSL library**: This update addresses a buffer overflow vulnerability in the OpenSSL library, which is used by Verus for encrypted node connections.\n\nThese security updates are essential to ensure the integrity and security of the Verus network, and it is recommended that all users update to version 0.9.9-2 or later to take advantage of these fixes.",
    "### Verifying Downloads\nA txt file containing the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature, is included for each download. These packages have been signed with the identity \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\".\n1) Extract downloaded archive\n2) Verify signature for the extracted archive using the extracted text file.\n3) Extract archive to desired directory\n#### CLI examples\n**Verifying file directly**\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AcKVJQABQR8REvfAnC1o2X3i+ya+XijCwxWtNunasCWLtCP5tZsdDm9Zg0kxb8k95KWLZwH7QZMkirXreo/bNHmo+c5DeKgE\" \"/Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.9-3-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.9-3-x86_64.tar.gz\"\n```\n**Verifying using a checksum**\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AcKVJQABQR8REvfAnC1o2X3i+ya+XijCwxWtNunasCWLtCP5tZsdDm9Zg0kxb8k95KWLZwH7QZMkirXreo/bNHmo+c5DeKgE\" 50229f3f126cc77abaf6ea4e28d27d6c5ba25acbbaae9c6bff48b1f73924ead0\n```**The result will be true if the signature is valid.**\n```\ntrue\n```\n## v0.9.9-2\nAnnouncing v0.9.9-2 - CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE FOR MAINNET AND REQUIRED UPDATE TO RESUME SUCCESSFUL MERGE MINING NOTARIZATION ON TESTNET#### Important Mainnet Security Updates**\nv0.9.9-2 introduces new mitigation code for the **Rab13s** vulnerability, announced by Halbourne 3 days ago as a zero day vulnerability in over 280 blockchains, including Zcash and Verus, that could allow someone to attack and bring down specific nodes that they may target through exhausting the node\u2019s resources. The Verus fix adapts a fix implemented in Zcash that also does a better job of preserving privacy while gossiping transactions around the network by making it harder to track their node of origin via listening nodes.This release also includes an important update of the OpenSSL library, which Verus uses for encrypted node connections and addresses a buffer overflow vulnerability in that library.",
