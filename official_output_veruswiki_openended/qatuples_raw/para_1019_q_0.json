    "How does Verus enable the buying and selling of VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain, and what is the purpose of Verus Vault in protecting funds on a VerusID?",
    "Verus provides a decentralized marketplace for buying and selling VerusIDs and NFTs directly on the blockchain. This marketplace allows users to advertise their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or post the sale of their NFT on the blockchain for anyone to see. Transactions are executed in a completely decentralized and peer-to-peer manner, without the need for intermediaries. Users can pay or offer to pay from transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, which are still auditable by the user. Additionally, users can accept payment to either type of address.\n\nThe Verus ID and NFT marketplace also allows owners to select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. This marketplace is a significant evolution of the VerusID, which is a powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.\n\nVerus Vault is a feature that provides an additional layer of security for funds stored on a VerusID. When a VerusID is locked with Vault, the owner cannot spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. However, the owner can still stake those funds on the Verus network and earn rewards. The owner can also still receive funds while the VerusID is locked. To enable revocation, recovery, and Verus Vault capabilities, users need to have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured. This ensures that users have complete control over their funds and identities, while also providing an additional layer of security against theft or loss.",
