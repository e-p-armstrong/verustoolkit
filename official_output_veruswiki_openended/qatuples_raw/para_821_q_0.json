    "What are the key features and upgrades included in the protocol release candidate for mainnet PBaaS, and how do they improve the functionality and usability of Verus and its ecosystem?",
    "The protocol release candidate for mainnet PBaaS includes several key features and upgrades that improve the functionality and usability of Verus and its ecosystem. \n\nFirst, the release includes upgrades to the VerusID protocol, which enable more advanced identity management and decentralized applications on the Verus network. \n\nSecond, the release includes the launch of Verus DeFi, which provides a decentralized finance platform for the Verus ecosystem. This platform allows for the creation of decentralized, auditable stable coins, among other things.\n\nThird, the release includes functional fixes and improvements to the website, including full support for mapped currencies and simple commands for mapping Verus currencies to any ERC20 currencies on Ethereum. This means that users can easily map their Verus currencies to Ethereum-based currencies, such as DAI, USDT, or USDC, and use them as fully decentralized, auditable stable coins.\n\nFourth, the release includes changes to the Verus Proof of Power consensus algorithm, which enable smoother starts, restarts, and general operation of PBaaS chains, regardless of their native currency supply or emission schedule.\n\nFifth, the release includes the launch of the new Ethereum bridge, which enables full use of Ethereum mapped currencies on the Goerli Ethereum testnet. This bridge provides a seamless way to move funds between the Verus and Ethereum networks, and allows users to take advantage of the strengths of both ecosystems.\n\nOverall, this release represents a significant upgrade to the Verus ecosystem, and provides a solid foundation for further growth and development in the future.",
    "This update includes the first protocol release candidate for mainnet PBaaS, VerusID protocol upgrades, and Verus DeFi. In addition to some functional fixes and full web site support for mapped currencies and simple commands for mapping Verus currencies to any ERC20 currencies on Ethereum with provable, auditable 1:1 mapping and cross chain send/receive. In addition this new protocol upgrade changes some parameters of the Verus Proof of Power consensus algorithm, enabling smoother starts, restarts, and general operation of PBaaS chains, regardless of their native currency supply or emission schedule. As these consensus parameter changes would require either a testnet fork, which would not be relevant for the mainnet upgrade or a reset, accessing the v0.9.3 testnet requires that you reset your local testnet by deleting the vrsctest and pbaas data folders from the locations described below.As part of this release, we will be launching the new Ethereum bridge and enable full use of Ethereum mapped currencies on the Goerli Ethereum testnet (note that we were previously using Rinkeby). This makes it easy for any currency definition to become a fully decentralized, auditable stable coin, simply by mapping to DAI, USDT, USDC, or another stable coin on Ethereum. In addition, the new website for Metamask support and use from Ethereum now displays all mapped currency options, even those added when someone exports a currency definition to Ethereum, either as a mapped currency or for using any Verus or PBaaS currency as an ERC20.This release also resolves an issue with setting max preconversion amounts on currency launches and addresses a number of minor protocol issues found as a result of the active community testing support we are seeing on testnet.",
