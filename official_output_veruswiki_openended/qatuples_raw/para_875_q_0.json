    "How does Verus enable the creation of new blockchains and support their growth, including features such as crowdfunding currency launches, interoperability, and unlimited scalability?",
    "Verus provides a range of features that enable the creation of new blockchains and support their growth, including crowdfunding currency launches, interoperability, and unlimited scalability.\n\n**Crowdfunding Currency Launches:**\nVerus allows for blockchain-based crowdfunding currency launches with minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge). This means that developers can set required minimum levels of worldwide participation in their preferred currencies on the chain. If the minimums are not met by the start time of the blockchain, all participants will automatically receive a refund of all their pre-conversions, minus network fees. Additionally, launch options provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations.\n\n**Interoperable, Multichain Network:**\nVerus enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, enabling public blockchains available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains. These private blockchains are easy to set up, with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network and back, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that may continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.\n\n**Unlimited Scalability:**\nThe Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows for unlimited scalability, with no limit on the number of blockchains that can operate and interoperate on the network. While there is some overhead for cross-notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network enables seamless connectivity and unlimited growth.\n\nOverall, Verus provides a robust platform for creating and growing new blockchains, with features such as crowdfunding currency launches, interoperability, and unlimited scalability. This enables developers to build and deploy new blockchain-based applications and services with ease, and provides a powerful platform for the growth of the blockchain ecosystem.",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.
