    "What is the concept of Verus Vault and how does it provide decentralized protection and recovery for funds, IDs, and NFTs?",
    "Verus Vault is a decentralized solution that provides an advanced level of blockchain protection and recovery for funds, IDs, and NFTs. It achieves this through the use of locked VerusIDs, which can be revoked and recovered by designated authorities in case of unauthorized access.\n\nHere's how it works: when a VerusID is locked, it can only be accessed or spent after a predetermined unlock time, which can be set to a specified period, such as 24 hours. During this time, the primary keys, even if they are part of a multisig arrangement, cannot access the funds. However, the revocation and recovery authority identities can still revoke and recover the locked ID, effectively circumventing the lock.\n\nThis mechanism provides a decentralized solution to the \"5-dollar wrench attack\", where an attacker tries to gain access to a user's funds by coercing them into revealing their private keys. With Verus Vault, even if an attacker gains access to the primary keys, they will still be unable to access the funds immediately, giving the user or a designated authority time to respond and recover the locked ID.\n\nIn addition to providing protection against unauthorized access, Verus Vault also offers other features, such as time locks for vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This allows users to create complex arrangements for the management and distribution of their assets, while ensuring that they remain secure and protected.\n\nFurthermore, Verus Vault also provides a way to export IDs to a PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service) chain, which can be done using the Verus command-line interface. This allows users to move their IDs and assets to a private chain, where they can be managed and protected more securely.\n\nOverall, Verus Vault provides a powerful and decentralized solution for protecting and recovering funds, IDs, and NFTs, giving users more control and security over their blockchain assets.",
    "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",
