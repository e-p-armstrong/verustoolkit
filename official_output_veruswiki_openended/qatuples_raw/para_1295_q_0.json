    "What improvements and updates have been made to the Verus CLI, specifically for the testnet, and how do these changes affect the user experience?",
    "The Verus CLI has undergone significant improvements and updates, particularly for the testnet. These changes aim to enhance the user experience and provide more features and functionality.\n\nOne of the key updates is the addition of the `getcurrencybalance` API, which allows users to retrieve multi-currency balances on both transparent and private addresses, as well as identities. This feature provides users with a more comprehensive view of their balances across different currencies.\n\nAnother improvement is the optimization of multi-currency operators and UTXO selection. This update aims to make transactions more efficient and streamlined, reducing the complexity and time required to process multi-currency transactions.\n\nThe `getwalletinfo` command has also been updated to display unlocked balances, providing users with a more accurate and up-to-date view of their available funds.\n\nFurthermore, the `z_getbalance` API now supports the \"z*\" wildcard, allowing users to retrieve balances for multiple z-addresses with a single command.\n\nNotably, all new `sendcurrency` features are now available on both mainnet and testnet, enabling users to take advantage of these features in a testing environment before deploying them on the mainnet. Additionally, testnet users can now source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses, providing more flexibility and options for testing and development.\n\nOverall, these updates demonstrate the ongoing development and improvement of the Verus ecosystem, with a focus on enhancing the user experience and providing more features and functionality for users.",
