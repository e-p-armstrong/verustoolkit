    "How do I use the `z_listunspent` and `z_mergetoaddress` commands in Verus, and what are their purposes?",
    "In Verus, there are two important commands: `z_listunspent` and `z_mergetoaddress`. Let's break them down:\n\n**`z_listunspent` Command:**\nThe `z_listunspent` command is used to list unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) in your wallet. You can use it in various ways, including:\n\n* `verus z_listunspent`: This will list all unspent transaction outputs in your wallet.\n* `verus z_listunspent 6 9999999 false [\"ztbx5DLDxa5ZLFTchHhoPNkKs57QzSyib6UqXpEdy76T1aUdFxJt1w9318Z8DJ73XzbnWHKEZP9Yjg712N5kMmP4QzS9iC9\",\"ztfaW34Gj9FrnGUEf833ywDVL62NWXBM81u6EQnM6VR45eYnXhwztecW1SjxA7JrmAXKJhxhj3vDNEpVCQoSvVoSpmbhtjf\"]`: This will list unspent transaction outputs that match the specified parameters, such as minimum confirmations, maximum amount, and a list of specific addresses.\n\nYou can also use `curl` to access the Verus JSON-RPC API and execute the `z_listunspent` method. The example provided shows how to do this.\n\n**`z_mergetoaddress` Command:**\nThe `z_mergetoaddress` command is used to merge multiple UTXOs and notes into a single UTXO or note. This command is currently disabled by default, but you can enable it by restarting `verusd` with the `-experimentalfeatures` and `-zmergetoaddress` command-line options, or by adding these lines to your `VRSC.conf` file:\n```\nexperimentalfeatures=1\nzmergetoaddress=1\n```\nOnce enabled, you can use `z_mergetoaddress` to merge multiple UTXOs and notes into a single UTXO or note. This is an asynchronous operation, and the UTXOs selected for merging will be locked. If there is an error, they will be unlocked. You can use the `listlockunspent` RPC call to return a list of locked UTXOs.\n\nProtected coinbase UTXOs are ignored by `z_mergetoaddress`, and you should use `z_shieldcoinbase` to combine those into a single note.\n\nIn summary, `z_listunspent` is used to list unspent transaction outputs, while `z_mergetoaddress` is used to merge multiple UTXOs and notes into a single UTXO or note. However, `z_mergetoaddress` is currently disabled by default and requires additional configuration to enable it.",
