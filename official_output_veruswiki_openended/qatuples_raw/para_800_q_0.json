    "What role do Komodo notarizations play in ensuring the stability of a PBaaS chain, and how do they interact with the proof of power protocol?",
    "In the context of a PBaaS (Private Blockchain as a Service) chain, Komodo notarizations can play a role in ensuring the stability of the chain tip. However, it's essential to understand that PBaaS chains are designed to operate independently, following their own proof of power protocol.\n\nWhen a PBaaS chain opts to use the Komodo notary service, Komodo notarizations can provide an additional layer of stability and security to the chain. These notarizations can help to prevent malicious attacks and ensure that the chain tip remains stable.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that even with Komodo notarizations present, PBaaS chains will always prioritize their proof of power protocol. This means that the chain will always follow its own consensus mechanism, which is designed to ensure the integrity and security of the chain.\n\nIn practice, this means that PBaaS chains will lock to their witnessed tips, which are determined by the proof of power protocol. This ensures that the chain remains autonomous and resistant to external influences.\n\nIn summary, Komodo notarizations can provide an additional layer of stability and security to a PBaaS chain, but the chain will always prioritize its own proof of power protocol and witnessed tips to ensure its autonomy and integrity.",
