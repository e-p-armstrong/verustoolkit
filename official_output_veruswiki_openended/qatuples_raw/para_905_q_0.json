    "What is the warranty and liability disclaimer for the Verus software, and what should I know about potential false positive virus detections?",
    "The Verus software is provided \"as is\" without any warranty, either express or implied. This means that the authors and copyright holders of the software are not responsible for any claims, damages, or other liability that may arise from the use of the software.\n\nIn particular, the software is not guaranteed to be merchantable, fit for a particular purpose, or non-infringing. Additionally, the authors and copyright holders are not liable for any damages or other liability, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from the use of the software.\n\nRegarding virus detections, some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software is mining software, which can be installed by a third party to exploit a user's computer.\n\nIt's important to note that these warnings are false positives, and the Verus software is not malicious. If you're concerned about these warnings, you can review the resources provided, such as the Malwarebytes blog post on PUP.Optional.BitcoinMiner and the Kaspersky blog post on \"Not-a-virus\", to learn more about why these false positives occur.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the Verus software has been scanned on VirusTotal, a website that analyzes files for malware, and the results are available for review. The links provided are for the MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows versions of the software, respectively.",
