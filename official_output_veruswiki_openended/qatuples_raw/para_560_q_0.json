    "How does Verus ensure the reliability and security of cross-chain transactions, and what features are being developed to enhance the VerusID APIs?",
    "Verus has implemented a notarization protocol that ensures the reliability and security of cross-chain transactions. This protocol, specified by `\u201cnotarizationprotocol\u201d:1`, allows chain launches to specify notary witnesses that will be used to validate transactions. Even if these witnesses stop operating for any reason, the protocol will automatically fail-over to auto-notarization, ensuring that cross-chain transactions can still be executed. This auto-notarization process relies on cryptographic proof and challenge resolution between merge miners and stakers, which can be slower than traditional notarization but still ensures the integrity of transactions.\n\nMoreover, Verus is developing new features to enhance the VerusID APIs. The `getidentityhistory` and `getidentitycontent` APIs provide real-time access to the mempool, allowing applications to index, organize, and aggregate an unlimited amount of user content referenced by an identity. These APIs also introduce self-sovereign delete operations, enabling applications to manage identity content efficiently. This technology has been used for oracle upgrade notifications and has the potential to facilitate future protocols that can handle diverse community opinions while respecting the sovereignty and decisions of all network members.\n\nIn summary, Verus' notarization protocol and enhanced VerusID APIs work together to ensure the security and reliability of cross-chain transactions, while also providing a robust framework for identity management and application development.",
    "Using `\u201cnotarizationprotocol\u201d:1`, which is also the default, a chain launch can specify notary witnesses that will be used when they do their job. Even if they stop witnessing for any reason, the protocol will fail-over to auto-notarization, ensuring that cross-chain transactions still function as expected, even if just for people to move their assets to another blockchain, although significantly more slowly and based solely on cryptographic proof and challenge resolution between merge miners and stakers. This cross-chain proof and challenge protocol operates even when witnesses are also operating and if miners and stakers continue to prove a more powerful chain than the one witnesses represent, the most powerful chain can still be confirmed. **(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**5. **Expanding L1 VerusID APIs**: This release provides a major enhancement to the identity content multimap support with two new APIs, `getidentityhistory` and `getidentitycontent` that provide real-time mempool access and also introduce self-sovereign delete operations to identity content that can be used by applications, making it easy for applications to index, organize, and aggregate an unlimited amount of user content referenced by an identity and made available to the application. This is the technology we used for oracle upgrade notifications, as all of this is available at L1, making it possible to imagine future protocols that can deal smoothly with diverse community opinions worldwide, but always respect the sovereignty and decisions of all members on the network. **(Testnet until the #LaunchPBaaS release)**",
