    "What are some important updates and considerations I should be aware of when using the Verus CLI or GUI wallet, including potential false positives from antivirus software and a critical security update?",
    "When using the Verus CLI or GUI wallet, there are several important updates and considerations you should be aware of. \n\n**False Positives from Antivirus Software:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). These warnings are not because the software is malicious, but because it is mining software that could potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. You can learn more about these false positives from resources such as Malwarebytes and Kaspersky.\n\n**Critical Security Update:**\nA critical security update was incorporated into Version 0.5.9 of the Verus wallet, which fixes a Zcash protocol issue. It is highly recommended that all users upgrade to this version or a more recent one immediately, and discontinue use of previous wallets.\n\n**Testnet Reset:**\nThe testnet was deleted and relaunched with the 0.5.9 release. If you have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to 0.5.9, you will need to delete certain directories before running the new update. The directories to delete vary depending on your operating system:\n\n* On Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSCTEST` and `~/.verustest`\n* On MacOS: `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/VRSCTEST` and `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069\u2068/VerusTest`\n* On Windows: `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST` and `\"%APPDATA%\"\\VerusTest`\n\nBy being aware of these updates and considerations, you can ensure the secure and proper use of your Verus wallet.",
