    "What is Verus Vault, and how does it provide decentralized protection and recovery of funds, IDs, and NFTs?",
    "Verus Vault is a security feature of the Verus protocol that provides a decentralized solution to protect and recover funds, IDs, and NFTs. It achieves this by allowing users to lock their VerusIDs, which can then be revoked and recovered by designated revocation and recovery authority identities in case of unauthorized access.\n\nHere's how it works: when a VerusID is locked, it cannot be spent or accessed without first unlocking it, which requires a predetermined unlock time to elapse. This delay provides an opportunity for the revocation and recovery authorities to detect and respond to any unauthorized unlock attempts, effectively preventing theft or loss of funds.\n\nThe Verus Vault feature is not limited to fund protection; it also provides security for IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for other use cases such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This feature is decentralized, meaning that it does not rely on third-party institutions like banks to ensure the security of assets.\n\nIn essence, Verus Vault offers a robust and decentralized solution to common forms of crypto loss or theft, such as the \"5 dollar wrench attack,\" by providing an additional layer of protection and recovery for Verus users.",
    "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyoe with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.## Testnet Reset\nTo reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):- Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`\n- Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/Library/Application\\ Support/VerusTest`\n- Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Roaming\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\\Komodo\\vrsctest\\`, `%AppData%\\Roaming\\VerusTest`## Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n  ```",
