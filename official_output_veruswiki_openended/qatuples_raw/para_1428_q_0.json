    "When downloading Verus software, it's essential to understand the terms of use and potential issues that may arise.\n\n**Terms of Use:**\nThe Verus software is provided \"as is\", without any warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that the authors or copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use or other dealings in the software.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because Verus is a mining software, which can potentially be installed by a third party to exploit your PC. However, this does not necessarily mean that the software is malicious. You can learn more about these false positives by reviewing resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky.\n\n**Verifying Safety:**\nTo verify the safety of the Verus software, you can check the VirusTotal detection ratios for the different OS versions:\n- MacOS: [link]\n- Linux-AMD64: [link]\n- Linux-ARM64: [link]\n- Windows: [link]\n\nBy understanding these terms of use and potential issues, you can make an informed decision about downloading and using the Verus software.",
