    "What are some of the additional capabilities of the Verus protocol, and how do they contribute to a decentralized and self-sovereign ecosystem?",
    "The Verus protocol offers several additional capabilities that contribute to a decentralized and self-sovereign ecosystem. These capabilities include:\n\n**On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs:**\nVerus enables the on-chain launch of tokens, centralized currencies, and liquidity basket AMMs, allowing for the creation and management of digital assets in a decentralized manner.\n\n**On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains:**\nVerus also enables the on-chain launch and merge mining of independent, connected, and interoperable blockchains, allowing for the creation of a network of interconnected blockchains without the need for programming.\n\n**On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles:**\nVerus provides on-chain self-sovereign, provable identities, NFTs, and individual or organizational profiles, enabling users to manage their digital identities and assets in a secure and decentralized manner.\n\n**Verus ID and NFT Marketplace:**\nThe Verus ID and NFT marketplace allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain, advertising their offers directly to the owner of an ID or NFT or posting the sale on the worldwide blockchain. This enables a decentralized and peer-to-peer trading experience, with transparent or zero-knowledge private addresses, and auditable transactions. Additionally, owners can select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership.\n\nThese capabilities demonstrate the Verus protocol's commitment to decentralization, self-sovereignty, and security, providing a robust ecosystem for users to manage their digital assets and identities.",
    "Having this notification remain in place until removed keeps the network running smoothly as it has been since activation, with all DeFi, multicurrency, and non-cross-chain functions enabled. Since the ETH bridge is undergoing final changes and review, is not quite ready to launch on testnet or mainnet, and will likely require at least a couple days on testnet to finish its review, we do not believe the current notification is hampering or slowing anything or anyone down at this time.\n### Additional Verus Capabilities\n- On-chain Launches of Token, Centralized Currency, and Liquidity Basket AMMs\n- On-chain Launches and Merge Mining of Independent, Connected, Interoperable Blockchains without Programming\n- On-chain Self Sovereign, Provable Identities, NFTs, and Individual or Organizational Profiles#### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.",
