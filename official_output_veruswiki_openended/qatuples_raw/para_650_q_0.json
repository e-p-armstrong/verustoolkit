    "What does it mean to set the `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency with Verus, and how does this impact the control of minting new coins?",
    "When defining a new currency with Verus, setting the `proofprotocol` to 2 means that the currency will use PROOF_CHAINID as its proof protocol. This has a significant impact on the control of minting new coins.\n\nPROOF_CHAINID is a proof protocol that allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. This means that the entity controlling the chain ID has the authority to create new coins and add them to the circulating supply.\n\nIn the example provided, when defining the currency \"mycoin\", setting `proofprotocol` to 2 allows the controller of the chain ID to mint new coins. This is demonstrated by the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```\nThis command allows the controller of the chain ID to mint 10,000 new \"mycoin\" coins and send them to the address \"mike@\".\n\nIn summary, setting the `proofprotocol` to 2 when defining a new currency with Verus gives the controller of the chain ID the authority to mint new coins, allowing them to control the supply of the currency. This can be useful in certain use cases, such as when a central authority needs to control the monetary policy of a currency.",
    "```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\nIn \"mycoin\", I set proofprotocol to 2, which is PROOF_CHAINID. That means that the controller of the chain ID can mint new coins as follows:```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"mycoin@\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"currency\":\"mycoin\",\"mintnew\":1,\"amount\":10000}]'\n```",
