    "How can you use Verus commands to manage your accounts, addresses, and balance?",
    "Verus provides several commands to manage your accounts, addresses, and balance. Here are some examples:\n\n**Getting an Account Address:**\nTo get an account address, you can use the `getaccountaddress` command. This command can be used with or without an argument. If no argument is provided, it will return the default account address. If an argument is provided, it will return the address associated with that account.\n\nHere are some examples:\n```\n> verus getaccountaddress\n> verus getaccountaddress \"\"\n> verus getaccountaddress \"myaccount\"\n```\nYou can also use the `curl` command to send a JSON-RPC request to the Verus daemon to get an account address.\n\n**Getting Addresses by Account:**\nThe `getaddressesbyaccount` command is deprecated and should not be used. It was used to return the list of addresses associated with a given account.\n\n**Getting Balance:**\nThe `getbalance` command returns the server's total available balance. You can use it with optional arguments to specify the account, minimum number of confirmations, and whether to include watch-only addresses.\n\nHere are some examples:\n```\n> verus getbalance\n> verus getbalance \"\" 1 true\n```\nThe `getbalance` command returns the total amount in VRSC received for the specified account.\n\nIn summary, Verus provides commands to manage your accounts, addresses, and balance. You can use `getaccountaddress` to get an account address, `getaddressesbyaccount` (although deprecated) to get addresses associated with an account, and `getbalance` to get the total available balance.",
