    "How do I create a new currency in Verus, and what are the requirements and implications of doing so?",
    "In Verus, creating a new currency requires a specific ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. This means that if you want to create a currency called \"gold@\", you need to have an ID called \"gold@\", and only the controller of that ID can create the currency \"gold@\".\n\nLet's break down the implications of this requirement. Having an ID of the same name as the currency you want to create ensures that the creator of the currency has full control over it. This is important because the creator of the currency is responsible for defining its properties, such as its name, options, and initial supply.\n\nIn the example mentioned, if you have three IDs - \"gold@\", \"mycoin@\", and \"mike@\" - you can create a currency called \"gold@\" using the \"gold@\" ID, and a currency called \"mycoin@\" using the \"mycoin@\" ID. The controller of each ID has full control over the corresponding currency.\n\nNow, let's talk about launching a currency. Launching a currency like \"gold@\" requires mapping it to a specific, auditable store of gold. This means that the creator of the currency needs to ensure that the currency is backed by a reliable and trustworthy store of gold, and that this store is auditable by third parties. This adds an extra layer of trust and transparency to the currency.\n\nOn the other hand, launching a token like \"mycoin@\" could be done in a way that's similar to a Kickstarter campaign. This means that the creator of the token can define its properties and rules, and then launch it to raise funds for a specific business or project. The token could represent a share in the business or project, and its value could be tied to the success of the venture.\n\nIn summary, creating a new currency in Verus requires a specific ID of the same name, and the controller of that ID has full control over the currency. Launching a currency requires careful planning and execution, including ensuring that it's backed by a reliable store of value and that its properties and rules are clearly defined.",
    "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a busines",
