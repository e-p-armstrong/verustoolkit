    "How does Verus allow users to park conversions of tokens before they launch, and how can new tokens be created that can be converted to with multiple other tokens?",
    "Verus provides a feature that enables users to park conversions of tokens before they launch. This is done using the `sendcurrency` command with specific parameters. For example, if a user wants to park a conversion of VRSCTEST to a new token called GOLD before it launches, they can use the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\n\nThis command effectively parks the conversion until the GOLD token launches. Once the token launches, the user will either find the converted amount of GOLD in their wallet or have their original VRSCTEST amount returned.\n\nAfter the launch of the GOLD token, users can create new tokens that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST. This is done using the `definecurrency` command with specific parameters. For example, to create a new token called mycoin that can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, the user can use the following command:\n\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"mycoin\",\"options\":33, \"proofprotocol\":2,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\", \"gold\"],\"minpreconversion\":[10000,5.1298]}, \"initialsupply\":20000'\n```\n\nThis command defines a new token named \"mycoin\" with specific properties, such as the currencies it can be converted to (VRSCTEST and GOLD), the minimum amounts required for conversion, and the initial supply of the token.",
    "T sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nthat would effectively park my conversion until the token launches, at which point, I will either find 0.975 GOLD in my wallet, or I will have my VRSCTEST back.\nAssuming it launches, and I later want to create mycoin, which can be converted to with either GOLD or VRSCTEST, I can create mycoin with:",
