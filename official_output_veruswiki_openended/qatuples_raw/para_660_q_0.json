    "How does Verus Vault protect my funds on a VerusID, and what are some additional security features it provides?",
    "Verus Vault is a security feature that allows you to protect your funds on a VerusID by locking it, making it impossible to spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked. Even if your private key is stolen, your funds will remain safe. While your VerusID is locked, you can still stake your funds on the Verus network and earn rewards, and you can also still receive funds. \n\nTo use Verus Vault, you need to have one primary identity and at least one revocation and recovery ID configured. A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which can circumvent the lock. However, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys, must first unlock the VerusID and then wait for a predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This provides an additional layer of security, as you or a third-party service can monitor the blockchain for unauthorized unlocks and revoke and recover the funds if necessary.\n\nVerus Vault also provides additional security features, such as time locks for other purposes like vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. It also protects your IDs and NFTs, providing a decentralized solution to common forms of crypto loss or theft. This means that you can preserve your blockchain wealth and assets without relying on a bank or other third-party institution.",
    "### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.",
