    "What is the purpose of the `decodescript` command in Verus, and how can it be used to decode a hex-encoded script?",
    "The `decodescript` command in Verus is a tool that allows users to decode a script that has been encoded in hexadecimal format. In other words, it takes a hex-encoded script as input and returns the decoded script.\n\nTo use the `decodescript` command, you would simply type `decodescript \"hex\"` into the command line, replacing `\"hex\"` with the actual hex-encoded script you want to decode.\n\nFor example, if you have a script encoded in hexadecimal format, such as `6a046d657461206e617469766520617373657420746f206d696e`, you would type `decodescript \"6a046d657461206e617469766520617373657420746f206d696e\"` into the command line.\n\nThe `decodescript` command would then take this hex-encoded script and decode it, returning the original script in a human-readable format.\n\nThe `decodescript` command is an important tool in the Verus ecosystem, as it allows users to easily decode and understand scripts that have been encoded in hexadecimal format. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as debugging, troubleshooting, or simply understanding how a script works.",
