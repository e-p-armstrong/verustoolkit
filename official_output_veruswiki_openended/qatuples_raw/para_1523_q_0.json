    "How are VerusIDs created and rewarded, and how does the reward system work?",
    "VerusIDs are created through a process that involves mining and staking on the Verus blockchain. When a new ID is created, a reward system is triggered that distributes Verus Coins (VRSC) to various participants. Here's how it works:\n\nWhen a new ID is mined into a block, rewards are distributed as follows:\n\n* 20 VRSC are sent to the referrer's ID (the person who referred the new ID creator)\n* 20 VRSC are sent to the referrer's referrer's ID (the person who referred the referrer)\n* 20 VRSC are sent to the referrer's referrer's referrer's ID (the person who referred the referrer's referrer)\n* 20 VRSC are sent to the miner of the block in which the ID is mined\n\nThis reward system is designed to incentivize the creation and promotion of new IDs on the Verus network. The referrer system encourages users to invite others to create IDs, while the miner reward ensures that the network is secured and maintained by miners and stakers.\n\nIt's worth noting that 100% of all funds that are not paid to referrers go to miners or stakers of the blockchain. This means that the Verus network is decentralized and community-driven, with rewards distributed fairly and transparently to those who contribute to its growth and security.",
