    "How do I create a currency on the Verus platform, and what are the requirements for doing so?",
    "To create a currency on the Verus platform, you need to have an ID of the same name as the currency you want to create. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. This means that if you want to create a currency called \"gold@\", you need to have an ID named \"gold@\".\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **ID ownership**: The controller of the ID with the same name as the currency is the only one who can create that currency. This ensures that only one person or entity can create a currency with a specific name.\n2. **Unique creation**: Each ID can only create a currency of the same name once. This prevents duplicate currencies with the same name from being created.\n\nLet's take the example of creating a currency called \"gold@\" that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold. To do this, you would need to have an ID named \"gold@\", and then use the Verus platform to create a currency with the same name. This currency would then be mapped to the store of gold in a way that is widely trusted.\n\nSimilarly, if you want to create a token called \"mycoin@\" that is used for a specific purpose, such as a Kickstarter-like fundraising campaign, you would need to have an ID named \"mycoin@\" and then create a currency with the same name using the Verus platform.\n\nIn summary, creating a currency on Verus requires having an ID with the same name as the currency, and the controller of that ID can only create the currency once. This ensures a high level of security and trust in the creation and management of currencies on the platform.",
    "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business,",
