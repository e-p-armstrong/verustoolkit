    "What is the PHP staking interface for coinshielding nodes, and how do I set it up to stake on my permanently running machine using Verus CLI?",
    "The PHP staking interface for coinshielding nodes is a tool that allows you to stake your Verus coins on your permanently running machine using the Verus Command-Line Interface (CLI), without the need to run the Agama GUI wallet.\n\nTo set up the PHP staking interface, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Download the necessary files**\n\nYou will need to download the following files:\n\n* The latest Verus Wallet from the official Verus website\n* The Verus Bootstrap from the official Verus Bootstrap website\n* The Verus-Staking-CLI from the GitHub repository\n\n**Step 2: Set up your Verus daemon**\n\nYou will need to set up your Verus daemon for the first time by following the guide on the Verus-Staking-CLI GitHub repository. This will involve creating a transparent address, a zs address, and running the daemon with the correct parameters (`-mint -cheatcatcher=zs...`).\n\n**Step 3: Configure your PHP staking interface**\n\nOnce you have set up your Verus daemon, you can configure your PHP staking interface to automate the staking process. This includes automatic shielding and unshielding of coinbase (staking, solo mining), automatic tracking of total coins generated, and optional email notifications on newly generated coins.\n\n**Important Notes**\n\n* Make sure to use a different `wallet.dat` for each node you are staking on.\n* Do not stake with the same `wallet.dat` on multiple nodes.\n\nThe PHP staking interface provides several features that make it easy to manage your Verus staking, including:\n\n* Automatic shielding and unshielding of coinbase (staking, solo mining)\n* Automatic tracking of total coins generated\n* Optional email notifications on newly generated coins\n* Optional periodical wallet.dat backups, also as an encrypted ZIP archive\n* Optional periodical wallet balance email notifications\n\nBy following these steps, you can set up your PHP staking interface and start staking your Verus coins on your permanently running machine using Verus CLI.",
