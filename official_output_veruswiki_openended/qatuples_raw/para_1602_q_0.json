    "There are several commands in Verus that allow you to retrieve currency state information and perform specific actions. Here are a few examples:\n\n**Getting Currency State Information:**\nTo get the current price in reserve and other currency statistics for the most recent block, you can use the `getcurrencystate` command:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate\n```\nIf you want to get the currency state information for a specific block, you can specify the block number:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate blocknum\n```\nAdditionally, you can retrieve currency state information for a range of blocks with a specific period between them:\n```\n./verus -chain=RESERVEWITHPREMINE getcurrencystate startblocknum,endblocknum,blockstostep\n```\n**Refunding Failed PbaaS Chain Launches:**\nIf a PbaaS chain launch fails, you can refund the contributions made to it using the `refundfailedlaunch` command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST refundfailedlaunch CHAINNAME\n```\n**Important Disclaimers:**\nIt's important to note that the software is still experimental and unfinished, and use of it is at your own risk.
