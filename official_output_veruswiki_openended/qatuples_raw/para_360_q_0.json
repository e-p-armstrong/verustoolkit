    "What are some important limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency features in Verus, and what are the implications of these limitations?",
    "When working with multi-currency features in Verus, there are two important limitations to be aware of.\n\n**First Limitation: ID Name Conflicts**\nThe first limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. This is because using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. While the protocol does not prevent creating an ID with an i-address as its name, it is strongly advised not to do so, as it will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used. To avoid user confusion, the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations will be expanded.\n\n**Second Limitation: GUI Currency Name Conflicts**\nThe second limitation, specific to the GUI, is that if a currency is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata and will not be a limitation in the mainnet release.\n\n**Disclaimer and Licensing**\nIt is important to note that the software is experimental and unfinished, and use is at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage. The software is licensed under an open-source license, which grants permission to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software, as long as the enclosed copyright notice and permission notice are included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.",
    "#### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.### DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software.
