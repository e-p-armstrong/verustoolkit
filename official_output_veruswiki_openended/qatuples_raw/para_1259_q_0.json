    "What are the necessary steps to take when updating to a new version of Verus, specifically in relation to the testnet, and what kind of disclaimer should I be aware of when using this software?",
    "When updating to a new version of Verus, it is crucial to take certain steps to ensure a smooth transition, especially when it comes to the testnet. If you have previously launched VRSCTEST from a version prior to the current one, you will need to delete specific directories before running the new update.\n\nThe directories to delete vary depending on your operating system:\n* On Linux, you need to delete `~/.komodo/vrsctest`.\n* On MacOS, you need to delete `\u2068Users\u2069/\u2068{YourUserName}/\u2068Library\u2069/\u2068Application Support\u2069/\u2068Komodo/vrsctest`.\n* On Windows, you need to delete `\"%APPDATA%\"\\Komodo\\VRSCTEST`.\n\nIt is essential to note that Verus is experimental and unfinished software, and you should use it at your own risk. There is no warranty for any kind of damage that may occur. The software is provided \"as is,\" without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied.\n\nThe authors and copyright holders of Verus are not liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use. This includes, but is not limited to, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.\n\nIn summary, when updating to a new version of Verus, make sure to delete the required directories, and be aware of the disclaimer that comes with using this software.",
