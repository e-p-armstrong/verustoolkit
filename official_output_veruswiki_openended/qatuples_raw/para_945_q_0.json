    "When using Verus software, it is essential to understand the disclaimers and warnings associated with it. The software is provided \"as is,\" without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. This means that the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability arising from the software or its use.\n\nAdditionally, some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software is related to cryptocurrency mining, which can be exploited by third parties to misuse your computer. However, these warnings are false positives, and you can learn more about them by reviewing resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky.\n\nTo verify the safety of the Verus software, you can check the virus detection results on VirusTotal, a website that aggregates the detection results from various antivirus engines.
