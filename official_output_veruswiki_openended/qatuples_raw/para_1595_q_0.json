    "How do reserve ratios affect the price of a currency, and how do I connect to a PBaaS chain or participate in a blockchain launch using the command line?",
    "The reserve ratio of a currency has a significant impact on its price volatility when converting to or from its reserve. When a currency has a reserve ratio of 1, its price remains stable during conversions. However, a currency with a lower reserve ratio, such as 0.1 or 10%, will experience more significant price fluctuations when converted to or from its reserve. This is because the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit affects the price.\n\nTo connect to a PBaaS chain, you can use the command `./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN`. This will create a local config file, allowing you to connect to the chain without needing to run VRSCTEST. However, VRSCTEST is still required for merge mining.\n\nThe presence of a correct config file for any chain, stored in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME` directory, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.\n\nTo participate in a blockchain launch and convert from a reserve before the chain has started, you can use the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"preconvert\": 1}'\n```\nThis command allows you to send a reserve with a pre-mine, specifying the payment and refund addresses, as well as the amount and pre-convert option.",
    "The initial price in reserve at chain launch will start at 1.0, but there will be some fees to be paid in the early blocks that will come in as reserve currency. All fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency are effective purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and based on a reversible formula, a currency's price will rise or fall on conversion from or to reserves with a level of volatility that is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve. A currency with a reserve of 0.1 or 10% will rise or fall fairly quickly when converted to or from, depending on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit.**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:**\n```\n./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\nOn first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.## Here are a few examples of cross-chain operations using the command line:**Participating in a blockchain launch and converting from reserve before the chain has started (refund address is optional and will default to paymentaddress):**\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"preconvert\": 1}'\n```",
