    "What is VerusID, and why is it important to upgrade to the latest version of Verus to support it, even if some antivirus software may flag the installation as a potential issue?",
    "VerusID is a fully functional blockchain protocol that provides a decentralized identity system. Unlike most blockchain ID implementations, there is no corporation involved in the protocol, giving users full control over their identities. VerusID offers numerous opportunities for identity applications, including the ability to receive and send funds, quantum resistance, full decentralization, revocability, recoverability, privacy, and power.\n\nIt is essential to upgrade to the latest version of Verus, specifically version 0.6.0-6, to support VerusID. This upgrade fixes a rare but potential issue that can corrupt individual wallets in the case of a specific type of reorg occurrence. The latest version includes activation support for VerusID and relative adjustments to the CPU and FPGA-equalizing VerusHash 2.1 Algorithm.\n\nSome antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus installation as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" due to the inclusion of mining software. However, this is a false positive, and the software is safe to install. The warnings are simply due to the presence of mining software, which may be installed by a third party to exploit your PC.",
