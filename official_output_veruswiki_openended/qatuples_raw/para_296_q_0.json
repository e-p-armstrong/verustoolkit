    "How do I create a currency on the Verus platform, and what are the requirements and implications of doing so?",
    "To create a currency on the Verus platform, you need to have an ID with the same name as the currency you want to create. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. \n\nLet's consider an example to illustrate this process. Suppose we have three IDs: `gold@`, `mycoin@`, and `mike@`. We want to create a currency called `gold@` that is mapped to a specific, auditable store of gold, and another currency called `mycoin@` that offers some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\n\nTo define the currency `gold@`, we would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines the properties of the `gold@` currency, including its name, options, currencies it can be converted from, conversion rates, minimum pre-conversion amounts, and pre-allocations.\n\nBefore launching the currency, we need to fund the identity of the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST. Then, we can send the transaction returned by the `definecurrency` command to initiate the currency launch. The launch will start 50 blocks from when the transaction was made (by default), and will require 1000 VRSCTEST to be pre-converted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\n\nAs part of the mining process, mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. After the currency launches, the only way to create new tokens is through a centralized issuance option.\n\nTo convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, we can issue a command like:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"amount\":1000}]'\n```\nThis command converts 1000 VRSCTEST to GOLD at the specified conversion rate.",
    "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":32,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n ```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTE",
