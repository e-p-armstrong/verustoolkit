    "How do I create a new currency in Verus, and what are the necessary steps to launch it, using a hypothetical example of creating two currencies, \"gold\" and \"mycoin\"?",
    "In Verus, creating a new currency requires an ID with the same name as the currency. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once. Let's explore how to create two currencies, \"gold\" and \"mycoin\", as a hypothetical example.\n\n**Creating the \"gold\" Currency:**\nTo create a currency called \"gold\", you need an ID named \"gold@\". The controller of this ID can define the currency using the `definecurrency` command. Here's an example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nThis command defines a new currency called \"gold\" with specific properties:\n\n1. `name`: The name of the currency, which must match the ID name.\n2. `options`: An integer that configures the currency's behavior.\n3. `currencies`: A list of currencies that can be converted to \"gold\".\n4. `conversions`: The conversion rate between VRSCTEST and GOLD.\n5. `minpreconversion`: The minimum amount of VRSCTEST required to launch the currency.\n6. `preallocations`: An allocation of GOLD to a specific ID, in this case, \"mike@\".\n\nBefore launching the currency, you need to fund the ID with at least 10 VRSCTEST and send the transaction returned from the `definecurrency` command. The currency launch will start 50 blocks from when the transaction is made, and it requires 1000 VRSCTEST to be preconverted at a rate of 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD. The mining process will earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD.\n\n**Launching and Using the \"gold\" Currency:**\nAfter the currency launches, you can convert VRSCTEST to GOLD using the `send` command. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST send...\n```\n**Creating the \"mycoin\" Currency:**\nSimilarly, to create a currency called \"mycoin\", you need an ID named \"mycoin@\". The controller of this ID can define the currency using the `definecurrency` command, specifying the desired properties and conversion rates.\n\nIn summary, creating a new currency in Verus requires an ID with the same name, defining the currency properties using the `definecurrency` command, funding the ID with the required amount of VRSCTEST, and sending the transaction to launch the currency. After launch, you can use the currency for transactions and conversions.",
    "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\"name\":\"gold\",\"options\":96,\"currencies\":[\"vrsctest\"],\"conversions\":[0.01],\"minpreconversion\":[1000],\"preallocations\":[{\"mike@\":50000000.00000000}]}'\n```\nof course, since this is a test currency, I send myself some to start. The identity of the currency must be funded with at least 10 VRSCTEST before sending the transaction returned from this command to\ninitiate a currency launch that will start at 50 blocks from when it was made (default), and that must have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD in order to launch.\nall of this happens as part of the mining process, since mining the blocks that launch a currency earn the 0.025% conversion fees of participation\nin the launch, converting VRSCTEST to GOLD. I could send the following command before the block where GOLD token launches.\nAfter it launches, the only way at present to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. To convert VRSCTEST to GOLD, you could issue the command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sen",
