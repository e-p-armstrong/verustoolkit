    "How can I use the `sendcurrency` API to send and convert funds in Verus, and how do I define a new currency using the Verus command line?",
    "The `sendcurrency` API in Verus is a powerful tool that allows you to send and convert funds between different addresses and currencies. Here are some examples of how to use it:\n\n**Sending Funds:**\nYou can use `sendcurrency` to send funds from one address to another. For example, to send 10 VRSCTEST from `bob@` to `alice@`, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\nIf you want to send funds from all wallet funds to multiple recipients, you can use the `*` wildcard to specify the sender's address. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n```\n**Converting Funds:**\nYou can also use `sendcurrency` to convert funds from one currency to another. For example, to convert 10 VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency called VRSC-BTC, you would use the following command:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\nIf you want to convert funds to another reserve currency, such as BTC, through a fractional currency like VRSC-BTC, you can specify the `via` parameter. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n```\n**Preconverting Funds:**\nIn some cases, you may want to preconvert funds to a new currency before it is active. You can do this by specifying the `preconvert` parameter. For example:\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n```\n**Defining a Currency:**\nTo define a new currency in Verus, you need to have an ID with the same name as the currency. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency with that name, and they can only do so once.\n\nFor example, let's say you have an ID called `gold@` and you want to create a currency called `gold` that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold. You would use the `definecurrency` command to create the currency. Similarly, if you have an ID called `mycoin@` and you want to create a token called `mycoin` that offers some utility or product value, you would use the `definecurrency` command to create the token.\n\nNote that the specifics of how to define a currency will depend on the use case and the requirements of the currency.",
    "The `sendcurrency` API can be used to send and convert funds.\n- **Sending VRSCTEST from a single address (bob@) to a single recipient (alice@):**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"bob@\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n  ```\n- **Sending VRSCTEST from all wallet funds to two recipients (alice@ and bob@):**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"currency\":\"vrsctest\",\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10},{\"currency\":\"VRSCTEST\",\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10}]'\n  ```\n- **Converting VRSCTEST to a fractional basket currency, VRSC-BTC:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n  ```\n- **Converting VRSCTEST to another reserve, BTC through a fractional currency, VRSC-BTC:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"bob@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"BTC\",\"via\":\"VRSC-BTC\"}]'\n  ```\n- **Preconverting to new currency, NEWCOIN, before it is active:**\n  ```\n  verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"alice@\",\"amount\":10, \"convertto\":\"NEWCOIN\", \"preconvert\":true, \"refundto\":\"alice@\"}]'\n  ```## Defining a CurrencyTo create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a business, \"my\", offers to attribute the coins some utility or product value if the purchase exceeds a certain level.\nFirst, I could define the currency \"gold\" as follows:\n```\n",
