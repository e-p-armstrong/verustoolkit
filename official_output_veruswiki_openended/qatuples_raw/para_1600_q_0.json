    "How does Verus handle the initial price and fees of a new chain at launch, and how can users connect to and interact with these chains using the command line?",
    "When a new chain is launched on Verus, the initial price of the chain's reserve currency is set to 1.0. However, there are fees associated with the early blocks of the chain, which are paid in the reserve currency. These fees effectively act as purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and as a result, the currency's price will rise or fall based on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit. The rate of price change is inversely related to the reserve ratio, meaning that a currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will not change in price when converted to or from its reserve, while a currency with a lower reserve ratio will experience more volatility.\n\nOnce a chain is created, users can connect to it using the command line by running `./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN`, replacing `SOMECOIN` with the name of the chain they want to connect to. On the first connection, a local config file is created, and from then on, the Verus daemon (`verusd`) can connect to the chain without needing to run the Verus command-line client (`verus`). However, the Verus command-line client is still required for merge mining.\n\nThe presence of a correct config file for a chain, stored in the `.verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME` directory, allows the chain to load as an independent chain.\n\nVerus also supports cross-chain operations, such as participating in a blockchain launch and converting from reserve before the chain has started. This can be done using the `sendreserve` command, which takes a JSON object as an argument. For example:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"preconvert\": 1}'\n```\nThis command would send 5000 units of the reserve currency to participate in the launch of a chain called `RESERVEWITHPREMINE`, with the option to refund any excess funds to the specified refund address.",
    "The initial price in reserve at chain launch will start at 1.0, but there will be some fees to be paid in the early blocks that will come in as reserve currency. All fees in reserve that are converted to a fractional reserve currency are effective purchases of the fractional reserve currency, and based on a reversible formula, a currency's price will rise or fall on conversion from or to reserves with a level of volatility that is inversely related to the reserve ratio. A currency with a reserve ratio of 1 will never change its price when converting to or from its reserve. A currency with a reserve of 0.1 or 10% will rise or fall fairly quickly when converted to or from, depending on the amount of conversion relative to the total currency reserves on deposit.**Once a chain is made, anyone running the local VRSCTEST chain can connect to any defined chain with the command:**\n```\n./verusd -chain=SOMECOIN\n```\nOn first connection, a local config file is created, and VRSCTEST will not need to run to connect. However, it will be needed to merge mine.The presence of a correct config file for any chain, which are kept in .verustest/PBAAS/CHAINNAME, which is the home directory for a PBaaS chain, enables the chain to load as an independent chain.## Here are a few examples of cross-chain operations using the command line:**Participating in a blockchain launch and converting from reserve before the chain has started (refund address is optional and will default to paymentaddress):**\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendreserve '{\"name\": \"RESERVEWITHPREMINE\", \"paymentaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"refundaddress\": \"R9LkTaMn1XpjeorE4RjM6pMcy5Nxkx9jPM\", \"amount\":5000, \"preconvert\": 1}'\n```",
