    "What are the licensing terms and potential warnings related to using Verus software?",
    "The Verus software is licensed under permissive terms, allowing anyone to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software without restriction. However, this software is provided \"AS IS\", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. In other words, there is no guarantee that the software will work as expected, and the authors or copyright holders are not liable for any damages or other liability arising from the use of the software.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (potentially unwanted program), which are warnings that you are installing mining software that could be used to exploit your computer. This is a false positive, and you can review resources from Malwarebytes and Kaspersky to learn more about these warnings.\n\nTo verify the legitimacy of the software, you can check the virus detection results on VirusTotal for the MacOS, Linux-AMD64, and Windows versions of the software.\n\nIn summary, while the Verus software is provided without warranty and with some potential warnings from antivirus software, it is licensed under permissive terms that allow for free use and modification.",
