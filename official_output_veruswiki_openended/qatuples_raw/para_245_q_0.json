    "What are the `listreceivedbyaccount` and `listreceivedbyaddress` commands in Verus, and how do they work?",
    "The `listreceivedbyaccount` and `listreceivedbyaddress` commands in Verus are used to list the balances received by accounts or addresses, respectively.\n\n**List Received by Account (`listreceivedbyaccount`):**\nThe `listreceivedbyaccount` command returns a list of objects, each representing an account that has received payments. The command takes three optional arguments:\n\n1. `minconf`: The minimum number of confirmations before payments are included. The default value is 1.\n2. `includeempty`: A boolean indicating whether to include accounts that haven't received any payments. The default value is false.\n3. `includeWatchonly`: A boolean indicating whether to include watchonly addresses (see 'importaddress'). The default value is false.\n\nThe command returns a JSON array of objects, each containing the following information:\n\n* `involvesWatchonly`: A boolean indicating whether imported addresses were involved in the transaction. Only returned if imported addresses were involved.\n* `account`: The account name of the receiving account.\n* `amount`: The total amount received by addresses with this account.\n* `confirmations`: The number of confirmations of the most recent transaction included.\n\n**List Received by Address (`listreceivedbyaddress`):**\nThe `listreceivedbyaddress` command is similar to `listreceivedbyaccount`, but it lists the balances received by individual addresses instead of accounts. It takes the same three optional arguments as `listreceivedbyaccount`.\n\nBoth commands can be used to retrieve information about received payments, and they provide flexibility in terms of the level of detail and the types of addresses/accounts to include.\n\nExamples of using these commands include:\n```bash\n> verus listreceivedbyaccount\n> verus listreceivedbyaccount 6 true\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"listreceivedbyaccount\", \"params\": [6, true, true] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:27486/\n```\nNote that the `curl` example illustrates how to use the `listreceivedbyaccount` command with JSON-RPC.",
