    "What is Verus Vault, and how does it provide protection against common forms of crypto loss or theft, including the 5 dollar wrench attack?",
    "Verus Vault is a decentralized solution that provides a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery. It allows you to lock your VerusID, which can be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities in case of an unauthorized unlock. This means that even if someone gains access to your primary keys, they will have to wait for a predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access your funds.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n* When you lock your VerusID, you set a predetermined unlock time, such as 24 hours.\n* If someone tries to unlock your ID using your primary keys, they will have to wait for the unlock time to expire before they can access your funds.\n* Meanwhile, the revocation and recovery authority identities can revoke and recover your ID at any time, circumventing the lock and preventing the unauthorized access.\n\nThis solution provides protection against the 5 dollar wrench attack, where an attacker uses physical force or coercion to gain access to your private keys. With Verus Vault, even if an attacker gains access to your primary keys, they will not be able to access your funds immediately, giving you or a third-party service time to detect and respond to the unauthorized access.\n\nIn addition to protecting your funds, Verus Vault also provides security for your IDs and NFTs, as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This means that you can use Verus Vault to protect and recover your assets, preserving your blockchain wealth without the need for a bank or other centralized institution.",
    "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",
