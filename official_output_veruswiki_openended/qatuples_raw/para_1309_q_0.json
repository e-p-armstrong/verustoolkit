    "What is the purpose of the Verus Vault feature, and how does it provide theft-resistant protection for funds controlled by an ID?",
    "The Verus Vault feature is designed to provide an additional layer of security for funds controlled by a Verus ID. Its primary use case is to timelock an ID, which prevents any spending of funds controlled by that ID while still allowing the ID and its funds to be used for staking. This means that even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds unless they unlock the ID first and wait for the specified timelock period.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. **Timelocking an ID:** You can lock an ID for a specified period, which prevents any spending of funds controlled by that ID.\n2. **Staking still allowed:** Despite the lock, the ID and its funds can still be used for staking.\n3. **Unlocking and waiting period:** If someone tries to unlock the ID, they will have to wait for the specified timelock period before they can access the funds.\n4. **Revocation and recovery:** If you notice that your ID has been unlocked by someone else, you can revoke and recover the ID before any funds are lost.\n5. **Extra security measure:** For added security, you can modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it, ensuring that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys.\n\nThe Verus Vault feature provides a high level of theft-resistant protection for funds controlled by an ID, making it much more difficult for attackers to steal funds even if they compromise your private keys.",
    "The Verus Vault use case, which was originally described in the conception of the feature, is the ability to timelock an ID, which would prevent any spending of any funds controlled by that ID, while still allowing the ID and all its funds to be used for staking. If the timelock was set for one day when locked, the unlock operation itself will require a waiting period of one day, which can only be circumvented by a revocation followed by recovery operation. In practice, this means that even if someone compromises your private keys while an ID is locked, they cannot spend any of the funds (though they could stake them and delegate rewards to another address, which you could immediately see) unless they unlock the ID first and wait one day. If you notice that your ID has been unlocked by someone other than you, you can revoke and recover before any funds are lost at all. If you wanted to get extremely secure, to the point of covering a case where someone may steal your private keys without you knowing and then lay in wait until you unlock your identity, so they can pounce on your funds before you lock it again, you can actually modify the controlling private keys of an identity before unlocking it, which ensures that the unlocked funds become usable again under the control of freshly made, uncompromised keys. While we believe this unique Verus technology actually provides for fully theft-proof workflows and protection of all assets on the network under the control of an ID, we will generally refer to the technology as \"theft-resistant\" and disclaim all guarantees of fitness for any particular purpose as part of the \"experimental software\" disclaimer.",
