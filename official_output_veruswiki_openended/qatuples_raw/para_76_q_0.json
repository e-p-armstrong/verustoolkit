    "What is the reward structure for staking (Proof of Stake) or mining (Proof of Work) a block in Verus, and how does it change over time?",
    "The reward structure for staking or mining a block in Verus is designed to incentivize participants to contribute to the network's security and decentralization. The reward amount changes over time, with different eras having distinct reward schedules.\n\nIn the early stages of the network, the reward is designed to encourage rapid adoption and growth. As the network matures, the reward amount decreases to promote sustainability and prevent inflation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the reward structure:\n\n**Era 1:** The first week of the network's operation is characterized by a rapidly increasing reward, starting from 0 and rising to 384 VRSC per block. This era is designed to bootstrap the network and encourage early adoption.\n\n**Era 2:** The first month of operation is divided into four sub-periods, each with a decreasing reward amount. The reward starts at 384 VRSC per block and gradually decreases to 48 VRSC per block over the course of four months.\n\n**Era 3:** This era spans multiple years and is characterized by a gradual decrease in the reward amount every two years. The reward starts at 24 VRSC per block and halves every 1051200 blocks, approximately every two years.\n\nAn important note is that all rewards equal to or greater than 192 VRSC are time-locked, meaning they will mature at a random block between 129,600 and 1,181,520 blocks.\n\nOverall, the reward structure in Verus is designed to promote a sustainable and decentralized network, with a gradual decrease in rewards over time to prevent inflation and encourage responsible network growth.",
    "# Question: What reward do I get for staking (PoS) or Mining (PoW) a block?\n\nThe reward received depends of the blocknummer:\n\n##### Era 1:\n1st week: Block 0 - 10080 ==> 0 to 384 VRSC reward ==> 16,588,800 VRSC total this period (reward rising linearly and changing each block)\n##### Era 2:\n1st month: Block 10080 - 53279 ==> 384 VRSC reward ==> 8,294,400 VRSC total this period\n2nd month: Block 53280 - 96479 ==> 192 VRSC reward ==> 4,147,200 VRSC total this period\n3rd month: Block 96480 - 139679 ==> 96 VRSC reward ==> 4,147,200 VRSC total this period\n4th month: Block 139680 - 182879 ==> 48 VRSC reward ==> 2,073,600 VRSC total this period\n5th month: Block 182880 - 226079 ==> 24 VRSC reward ==> 1,036,800 VRSC total this period\n##### Era 3:\nYears 1+2: Block 226080 - 1277279 ==> 24 VRSC reward ==> 25,228,800 VRSC total this period\nYears 3+4: Block 1277280 - 2328479 ==> 12 VRSC reward ==> 12,614,400 VRSC total this period\nYears 5+6: Block 2328480 - 3379679 ==> 6 VRSC reward ==> 6,307,200 VRSC total this period\n. . . halving indefinitely every 1051200 blocks (approximately 2 years)\n\nAll rewards equal or over 192 VRSC are time locked to mature at a random block between 129,600 and 1,181,520\n\n(submitted by @keda666, edited by Oink.vrsc@)\n\nnote: last review date 2020-02-25.",
