    "What are the key features and benefits of Verus Vault, and how does it provide decentralized protection and recovery of funds, identities, and NFTs?",
    "Verus Vault is a powerful feature of the Verus protocol that provides a decentralized solution for protecting and recovering funds, identities, and NFTs. To enable Verus Vault capabilities, you need to have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.\n\nThe main benefit of Verus Vault is that it allows you to lock your VerusID, which means that anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys, must first unlock and then wait for a predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This unlock time can be set to a specific duration, such as 24 hours, which provides a decentralized solution to the infamous 5-dollar wrench attack.\n\nIn addition to this security feature, Verus Vault also provides a decentralized recovery mechanism. If an unauthorized unlock occurs, the revocation and recovery authority identities can revoke and recover the locked VerusID, circumventing the lock. This means that you can assign a revocation ID to a trusted party, such as a company that specializes in watching the blockchain, to revoke and recover your funds in case of an unauthorized unlock.\n\nVerus Vault not only provides protection and recovery for funds but also for identities and NFTs. It offers time locks for various purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. This means that you can create complex structures for managing your assets and ensuring their safe transfer to future generations.\n\nIn summary, Verus Vault provides a decentralized solution for protecting and recovering funds, identities, and NFTs, giving you a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery without the need for a bank. It offers a range of features and benefits, including decentralized protection against unauthorized access, recovery of funds in case of an unauthorized unlock, and time locks for managing complex asset structures.",
    "IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.#### New Verus Multicurrency, Multichain, DeFi Enabled Testnet\nWith an easy GUI for basic operations or command line for more advanced functions.
