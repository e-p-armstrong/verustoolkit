    "How do I create a currency on the Verus platform, and what are the requirements for doing so?",
    "To create a currency on the Verus platform, you need to have an ID (a VerusID) with the same name as the currency you want to create. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once. This means that if you want to create a currency called \"gold\", you need to have an ID called \"gold@\".\n\nThe controller of the ID has full control over the creation of the currency, and they can decide how to launch it and what features it will have. For example, if you want to create a currency called \"gold\" that is backed by a specific, auditable store of gold, you would need to have an ID called \"gold@\" and then use that ID to create the currency.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to create a token called \"mycoin\" that is similar to a Kickstarter, where a business can raise funds, you would need to have an ID called \"mycoin@\" and then use that ID to create the token.\n\nIt's important to note that the creation of a currency on Verus is a one-time event, and once a currency is created, it cannot be recreated. This ensures that the creator of the currency has full control over its creation and management.\n\nIn general, the creation of a currency on Verus requires a deep understanding of the platform and its features, as well as a clear vision for what the currency will be used for and how it will be managed.",
    "To create a currency of a specific name, you need an ID of the same name. The controller of this ID is the only one who can create a currency of that name, and they can only do so once.\nSo, let's hypothetically assume I have 3 IDs, one named gold@, one named mycoin@, and one named mike@. I would like to have one currency, gold@,\nthat I somehow launch in a way that maps it in a way that can be widely trusted to a specific, auditable store of gold.\nI also would like to launch a token called mycoin@, which is something like a Kickstarter, where a busines",
