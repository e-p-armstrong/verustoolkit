    "What is the concept of \"auto-notarization\" or \"Proof of Proof of Power\" in Verus, and how does it enable cross-chain bridging between Verus and other blockchain networks?",
    "In Verus, \"auto-notarization\" or \"Proof of Proof of Power\" is a novel cross-chain consensus technology that allows for cryptographically provable, cross-chain bridging across Verus and other blockchain networks, including PBaaS chains. This technology enables the secure transfer of assets between different blockchain networks without the need for trusted intermediaries or witnesses.\n\nIn traditional cross-chain bridging solutions, notary witnesses are required to facilitate the transfer of assets between chains. However, with \"auto-notarization\", Verus has developed a technology that can operate independently of notary witnesses, providing an additional layer of security and decentralization.\n\nThe way it works is that cross-chain transactions are checked against cryptographic evidence, making it difficult for anyone, including notary witnesses, to take any action that would go against the wishes of the majority of the network. This ensures that the integrity of the transaction is maintained, even in the absence of notary witnesses.\n\nWhile this technology is fully functional and has been designed with security in mind, it has not yet been proven to an academic standard. Therefore, it is recommended that serious PBaaS chains be launched with operational notary witnesses until further notice. However, the technology provides a security fallback against misbehaving notary witnesses and will continue to be developed and refined in the future.",
    "4. **Bridging Blockchain Networks Without Witnesses**: v0.9.9 is the first release of any blockchain protocol anywhere that we know of which enables cryptographically provable, cross-chain bridging across Verus and all PBaaS and other connected blockchains in the network, either combined with or independent of the need for notary witnesses. With notary witnesses, cross-chain transactions complete faster, but they are also checked against cryptographic evidence, making it difficult to impossible for anyone, including notary witnesses to take any action, even colluding with validators that would go against the wishes of the most chain power. We have been referring to this new cross-chain consensus technology as \u201cauto-notarization\u201d, as that is what it actually is, but it would also be accurate to call it Proof of Proof of Power, as that is how it works. For purposes of ensuring everyone understands the state of the technology, it is fully functional and we have taken great care to ensure it is sufficiently secure, but we have not yet had the protocol proven to an academic standard. Because of that, while it provides a security fall-back against misbehaving notary witnesses and will be fully functional and we believe sufficiently secure without notary witnesses on release, we currently recommend toconsider the protocol unproven at this time and that any serious PBaaS chains be launched with operational notary witnesses until further notice.",
