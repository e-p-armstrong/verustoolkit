    "How does Verus Vault provide decentralized protection and recovery of funds, IDs, and NFTs, and what benefits does it offer compared to traditional banking systems?",
    "Verus Vault is a decentralized solution that provides an additional layer of security and protection for funds, IDs, and NFTs on the blockchain. One of the key features of Verus Vault is the ability to lock a VerusID, which prevents unauthorized access to funds and assets. This lock can be set with a predetermined unlock time, which allows for a waiting period before the funds can be accessed.\n\nIn the event of an unauthorized unlock, the revocation and recovery authority identities can revoke and recover the locked VerusID, circumventing the lock. This means that even if someone gains access to the primary keys, they will not be able to access the funds immediately. The lock must first be unlocked, and then the predetermined unlock time must pass before the funds can be accessed.\n\nThis feature provides protection against the infamous \"5 dollar wrench attack\", where an attacker forces the owner to reveal their private keys. By setting a delay, such as 24 hours, the owner or a designated third-party service can monitor the blockchain and revoke the unlock if it was unauthorized.\n\nVerus Vault offers several benefits compared to traditional banking systems. It provides decentralized protection and recovery of funds, IDs, and NFTs, eliminating the need for a centralized authority. It also allows for the creation of custom vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance plans, giving users more control over their assets.\n\nAdditionally, Verus Vault enables the export of IDs to PBaaS chains, which can be done using the `sendcurrency` command. This allows for the transfer of assets and identities between different blockchain ecosystems.\n\nOverall, Verus Vault provides a robust and decentralized solution for protecting and recovering funds, IDs, and NFTs, offering a new level of security and control for users on the blockchain.",
    "A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.### Exporting an ID to a PBaaS chain\n```\nverus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"IDNAME@\",\"exportto\":\"PBaaSChainName\",\"exportid\":\"true\",\"amount\":100,\"currency\":\"vrsctest\"}]'\n```",
