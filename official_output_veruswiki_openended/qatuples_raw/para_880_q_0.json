    "How do I initiate a currency launch on the Verus network, and what are the requirements for a successful launch? Additionally, how can I convert VRSCTEST to a newly launched currency, and what are the options for creating new tokens?",
    "To initiate a currency launch on the Verus network, you need to fund the currency with at least 10 VRSCTEST and have 1000 VRSCTEST preconverted at a specified rate (in this case, 0.01 VRSCTEST per GOLD) in order to launch. This process happens as part of the mining process, where mining the blocks that launch a currency earns the 0.025% conversion fees of participation in the launch, converting VRSCTEST to the new currency.\n\nBefore the launch, you can park your conversion by sending a command that effectively reserves your conversion until the token launches. For example, to convert 100 VRSCTEST to GOLD, you would use the following command:\n```\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendcurrency \"*\" '[{\"address\":\"mike@\",\"convertto\":\"gold\",\"preconvert\":1,\"amount\":100}]'\n```\nThis will either result in 0.975 GOLD in your wallet or return your VRSCTEST after the launch.\n\nAfter a currency has launched, you can create new tokens that can be converted to with either the new currency or VRSCTEST. For example, to create a new token called \"mycoin\" that can be converted to with GOLD or VRSCTEST, you would need to define the properties of mycoin, such as the currencies it can be converted to, the conversion rates, and the initial supply.\n\nNote that at present, the only way to create new tokens is with a centralized issuance option. However, Verus provides a decentralized and flexible platform for creating and managing currencies, allowing for a wide range of use cases and applications.",
