    "What benefits does the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network provide for launching new blockchains and creating an interoperable network?",
    "The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network offers several benefits for launching new blockchains and creating an interoperable network. Here are some of the key advantages:\n\n**Seamless Connectivity and No Rent**: When a new blockchain is launched on the Verus network, all fees generated through cross-chain fee conversions or general use of the liquidity pool are earned on the new blockchain, with no rent or fees going back to the Verus blockchain. This ensures that the new blockchain has complete control over its own fees and revenue.\n\n**Blockchain-based Crowdfunding and Currency Launches**: Verus provides a blockchain-based crowdfunding system for launching new currencies. This system allows for minimum participation or automatic refunds, including for dual launches (blockchain and bridge). The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price-neutral pre-allocations to select IDs, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Additionally, vesting schedules can be included in the pre-allocations using VerusIDs.\n\n**Interoperable Multichain Network**: The Verus network enables the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. Notary IDs, specified at chain definition, provide decentralized blockchain-specific bridge confirmation, allowing public blockchains to be made available to the world for merge mining and staking, as well as private, internal blockchains. These private blockchains can be easily set up with easy bridging of public currencies into an organization and onto their internal private network, with all features and currencies of the public chain but none of the access. There is no limit on the number of blockchains that can continuously operate and interoperate on the Verus network.\n\n**Unlimited Scale**: The Verus network allows for unlimited scale, enabling the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains. While there is some overhead for cross-notarization, the model for the Verus blockchain network is designed to support unlimited growth and scalability.\n\nOverall, the Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network provides a robust and flexible platform for launching new blockchains and creating an interoperable network. It offers a range of benefits, including seamless connectivity, blockchain-based crowdfunding, and unlimited scale, making it an attractive option for organizations and developers looking to leverage blockchain technology.",

If by the start time of your blockchain, minimums are not met, all participants will automatically get a refund of all of their pre-conversions, less the network fees. The launch options also provide for maximum participation in one or more currencies, pre-launch discounts, price neutral pre-allocations to select IDs that increase the fractional reserve ratio to issue currencies, similarly price neutral carve-outs of proceeds, and pre-launch discounts for early participants. Using VerusIDs, launches can also include vesting schedules in the pre-allocations as well.\n## An interoperable, multichain network for new use cases and unlimited scale**\n- The Verus multi-currency, multi-chain network allows the creation of an unlimited number of interoperable blockchains in the Verus network.
