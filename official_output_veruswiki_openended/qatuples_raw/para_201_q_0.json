    "What is the structure of the result returned by a Verus operation, and what information does it contain about the transaction?",
    "The result returned by a Verus operation is a data structure that contains information about the transaction. It has two possible forms, depending on whether the `returntxtemplate` parameter is set to `true` or not.\n\n**If `returntxtemplate` is false:**\nIn this case, the result is a simple string that represents an \"operationid\". This operationid can be used to query the status of the operation using the `z_getoperationstatus` command.\n\n**If `returntxtemplate` is true:**\nIn this case, the result is a JSON object with two properties:\n* `outputtotals`: This is a map of currency values, where each key is a currency ticker and each value is the total output amount in that currency. This represents the total outputs of the transaction that need to be input.\n* `hextx`: This is a hexadecimal string that represents the transaction itself, with all specified outputs but no inputs.\n\nIn summary, the result of a Verus operation contains information about the transaction, including an operationid that can be used to query the operation status, and optionally, a template for the transaction with output totals and a hexadecimal representation of the transaction.",
    "#### Result:\n1. \"operationid\"     (string) An operationid to pass to z_getoperationstatus to get the result of the operation.\n2. If (returntxtemplate) is true  \n```json\n {\n  \"outputtotals\" : {currencyvaluemap}  Total outputs in all currencies the need to be input to the transaction\n  \"hextx\" : \"hexstring\"         The transaction with all specified outputs and no inputs\n }\n```",
