    "What kind of warranty does Verus provide for its software, and what should I do if my antivirus software flags it as a potential threat?",
    "Verus provides its software \"as is\", without any kind of warranty, whether express or implied. This means that the authors and copyright holders of Verus are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liability that may arise from the use of the software.\n\nRegarding antivirus software flagging Verus as a potential threat, it's not uncommon for antivirus software like Avast and Kaspersky to flag mining software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because mining software can be used by third parties to exploit your computer's resources without your consent.\n\nHowever, in the case of Verus, these warnings are false positives. To understand more about these false positives, you can review resources from reputable sources like Malwarebytes and Kaspersky, which explain why certain mining software may be flagged as potential threats.\n\nIf you're concerned about the warnings from your antivirus software, you can also check the virus detection results from multiple sources, such as VirusTotal, which provides a comprehensive detection rate from various antivirus engines.\n\nIn summary, Verus provides no warranty for its software, and if your antivirus software flags it as a potential threat, it's likely a false positive due to the software's mining capabilities.",
