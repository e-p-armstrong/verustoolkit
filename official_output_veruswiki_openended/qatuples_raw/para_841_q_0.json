    "The Verus software is provided \"as is\", without any warranties or guarantees of any kind. This means that the authors and copyright holders of the software are not liable for any claims, damages, or other liabilities arising from the use of the software.\n\nIt's also important to note that some antivirus software, such as Avast and Kaspersky, may flag the Verus software as \"not-a-virus\" or \"PUP\" (Potentially Unwanted Program). This is because the software is related to cryptocurrency mining, which may be installed by third parties to exploit your computer. However, this does not mean that the Verus software itself is malicious.\n\nTo verify the safety of the Verus software on different operating systems, you can check the virus detection results on VirusTotal, a reputable online platform that scans files and URLs for malware. The links provided for MacOS, Linux-x86-64, Linux-ARM64, and Windows allow you to view the detection results for each version of the software.\n\nAdditionally, you can review resources from reputable cybersecurity companies, such as Malwarebytes and Kaspersky, to learn more about false positives and the reasons why some antivirus software may flag the Verus software as potentially unwanted.\n\nIt's essential to be aware of these disclaimers and warnings to ensure that you use the Verus software responsibly and with caution.",
