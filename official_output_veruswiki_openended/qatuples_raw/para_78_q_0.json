    "What are the steps to bootstrap my Verus wallet, and where can I find the necessary files?",
    "Bootstrapping your Verus wallet is a process that helps you get started with your wallet by downloading the necessary blockchain data. There are three ways to do this: using Verus Desktop, using the Verus CLI, or doing it manually. Here are the steps for each method:\n\n**Using Verus Desktop:**\n\n1. Exit your profile in Verus Desktop by clicking the exit icon at the top right.\n2. Wait a minute or two for the wallet to close completely in the background.\n3. Click `help`, then `Bootstrap VRSC`. This will open a new window.\n4. Follow the instructions in the window, and when finished, select your preferred profile and enter Verus Desktop.\n\n**Using Verus CLI:**\n\n1. Go to the folder where your Verus CLI daemon is extracted (usually named `verus-cli`).\n2. Shutdown `verusd` and wait for it to close completely.\n3. Double-click `fetch-bootstrap` in your file browser.\n4. Follow the instructions, and when finished, start your `verusd` daemon as usual.\n\n**Manual Bootstrap Procedure:**\n\nTo bootstrap your wallet manually, you will need to download two necessary files:\n\n* The latest wallet from [https://verus.io/wallet.html](https://verus.io/wallet.html)\n* The Verus Bootstrap from [https://bootstrap.verus.io/](https://bootstrap.verus.io/)\n\nOnce you have these files, follow the instructions provided to complete the bootstrap process.\n\nNote: You can also watch a video explanation of the bootstrap process at [https://youtu.be/xgLxzel5t04](https://youtu.be/xgLxzel5t04).\n\nAdditionally, it's important to know where your Verus wallet files are located. The standard locations are:\n\n* Linux: `~/.komodo/VRSC`\n* Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`\n* Windows 10: `%AppData%\\Komodo\\VRSC\\`\n* OS independent through Verus Desktop: Click `help`, `Show Verus data folder (default)`\n\nYou can easily access these locations by copying and pasting them into your file browser's address bar.",
