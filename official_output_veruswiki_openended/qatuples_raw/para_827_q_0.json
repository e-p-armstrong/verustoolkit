    "What are the key features and benefits of the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, and how does Verus Vault enhance the security of funds stored on a VerusID?",
    "The Verus ID and NFT Marketplace is a decentralized platform that allows users to buy and sell VerusIDs and NFTs on-chain, directly and peer-to-peer, without the need for intermediaries. This platform offers several key benefits, including:\n\n* **Decentralized transactions**: Execute transactions directly on the blockchain, without the need for intermediaries.\n* **Transparent or private payments**: Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you.\n* **Auditable transactions**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and tamper-proof record of ownership and transactions.\n* **Support for value-added agents**: Owners can select and share proceeds with value-added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership.\n\nVerus Vault is an additional security feature that allows users to protect funds on a VerusID, even in the event of private key theft. With Verus Vault, users can lock their VerusID, making it impossible to spend funds from that identity until it is unlocked again. While locked, users can still receive funds and stake those same funds on the Verus network to earn rewards. To enable Verus Vault capabilities, users need to have one primary identity and at least one revocation/recovery ID configured.\n\nOverall, the Verus ID and NFT Marketplace, combined with Verus Vault, provides a powerful and secure platform for managing digital identities and assets, with features that prioritize user control, security, and transparency.",
    "### Verus ID and NFT Marketplace\nBuy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see.

Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don\u2019t worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It\u2019s the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.### Verus Vault\nWith Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key!

Of course, you can also still receive funds.IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.",
