    "What are some limitations of using multi-currency features in Verus, and what are the implications of these limitations for users?",
    "When using Verus, there are a few limitations to be aware of when working with multi-currency features. These limitations can affect how you use and interact with different currencies within the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**Limitation 1: Using an i-address as an ID name**\nOne limitation is that you cannot create a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name. This means that if you try to create a currency with an ID that has an i-address as its name, it will not work as expected. Instead, the system will interpret the i-address as referring to the currency or identity that has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. To avoid confusion, it's recommended to not create IDs with i-addresses as their names.\n\n**Limitation 2: Currency name conflicts (GUI only)**\nAnother limitation, specific to the Verus Desktop GUI, is that you cannot use the same name for a PBaaS chain as a currency that is already supported in the Verus Desktop, such as BTC or ETH. This limitation is considered a known issue and will be addressed before the mainnet release.\n\n**Disclaimer and License Information**\nIt's important to note that the Verus software is still experimental and unfinished, and users should be aware of the risks involved in using it. The software is provided without warranty, and users are responsible for any damage that may occur. However, the software is also open-source and permissively licensed, allowing users to modify, distribute, and use the software freely, as long as the copyright notice and permission notice are included.\n\nIn summary, when working with multi-currency features in Verus, it's essential to be aware of these limitations to avoid potential issues and conflicts. By understanding these limitations, users can use the Verus software effectively and safely.",
    "### Limitations in multi-currency to be aware of:\n1. (GUI and CLI) You will not be able to make a currency from an ID that has a properly encoded i-address as its actual name, not its calculated ID. Generally, the advice is \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d. Using an i-address when referring to a currency will only be interpreted as referring to the currency or identity which has that i-address calculated based on its name registration. As a general rule, making an ID with an i-address as its name is not prevented by the protocol, but will cause problems whenever an i-address or name may be used (many cases) and will not be supported for creating currencies. To reduce any potential for user confusion, even though the naming system provides will also be expanding the set of characters that will not be allowed for currency registrations.2. (GUI) If a currency is supported in the Verus Desktop already, such as BTC or ETH, you will not be able to use those same named currencies as a PBaaS chain. This limitation is considered errata for this testnet release and will not be a limitation before mainnet availability.# DisclaimerThis is experimental and unfinished software. Use at your own risk!
