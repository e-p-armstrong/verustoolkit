    "How can you verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus download using the provided signature and checksum, and what are some of the key features and changes introduced in version 0.9.9-3 of the Verus software?",
    "To verify the authenticity and integrity of a Verus download, you can use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` commands provided by the Verus software. These commands allow you to check the signature and checksum of the downloaded file against the expected values, ensuring that the file has not been tampered with or corrupted during transmission.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide on how to verify a Verus download:\n\n1. Extract the downloaded archive to a temporary directory.\n2. Locate the `txt` file that contains the signer, standard sha256 file checksum, and signature.\n3. Use the `verifyfile` or `verifyhash` command to verify the signature and checksum of the extracted file.\n\nThe `verifyfile` command takes three arguments: the identity of the signer, the signature, and the path to the file to be verified. For example:\n```\n./verus verifyfile \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AUqqJQABQR9eyv2N6JbDY8HAvGMn5mR2NYLW3sA0jbud0we0KNyGuAV4Upp/qPgl9265PL4ZkjBLY45BrkIstubavegqwn+u\" \"/Downloads/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.9-4-x86_64/Verus-CLI-Linux-v0.9.9-4-x86_64.tar.gz\"\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `verifyhash` command to verify the checksum of the file. This command takes three arguments: the identity of the signer, the signature, and the expected checksum. For example:\n```\n./verus verifyhash \"Verus Coin Foundation Releases@\" \"AUqqJQABQR9eyv2N6JbDY8HAvGMn5mR2NYLW3sA0jbud0we0KNyGuAV4Upp/qPgl9265PL4ZkjBLY45BrkIstubavegqwn+u\" f5577a74e2d279b62aa42d85359f8d608ebc1ad7464556251ea29e7a36b6472c\n```\nIf the signature and checksum match, the command will output `true`, indicating that the file is authentic and has not been tampered with.\n\nRegarding version 0.9.9-3 of the Verus software, this release introduces a new feature called `prunespentwallettransactions`, which allows holders of very large wallets to prune older spent transactions. This can improve performance for wallets that may be slowing down due to size. Additionally, this release does not include any mainnet protocol changes over the prior release.",
