    "What is the process to send a raw transaction in the Verus CLI interface, and what is the significance of the result obtained from this process?",
    "In the Verus CLI interface, you can send a raw transaction using the `sendrawtransaction` command. This command takes a hexadecimal string as an argument, which represents the raw transaction data. To use this command, you need to first obtain the hexadecimal string, which can be done through a previous step in the process.\n\nThe format of the command is:\n```bash\nsendrawtransaction <\"hex\"-string>\n```\nReplace `<\"hex\"-string>` with the actual hexadecimal string representing the raw transaction data.\n\nWhen you run this command, it will result in a TXID (Transaction ID) being displayed, which is a unique identifier for the transaction. This TXID can be used to monitor the progress of the transaction in your wallet or to look up the transaction details in a blockchain explorer.\n\nIt is essential to note that the hexadecimal string and the resulting TXID are specific to your transaction and should not be shared or used from an example. You should always use the results from your own wallet to ensure the security and integrity of your transactions.\n\nAfter successfully sending the raw transaction and removing funds locked in a b-address, it is recommended to exercise caution when sending funds to addresses and to consider importing the used addresses into a fresh wallet, excluding all unused (b-) addresses, to maintain a clean and organized wallet setup.",
    "3. In the CLI interface adapt and issue this command `sendrawtransaction <\"hex\"-string from step 2>`.\nIn our example that would look like this:\n```bash\nrun sendrawtransaction 0400008085202f8901150f82b53214fe0cb34b3bd57885f6f841384373b173ba6718f31ef6eb6259fa0a000000694c67010101012102c9ca37dac14c819a99ce4a71533ab8d3d5e37643ede9c4da0981081a074f75df40531ea63fb3de6111949652111bbe524506999c97c06302715e85aa5c5813519b3eace4ac15bb3950600f968c0c555a935fd826f1a51e00bd2a7f12d035757fc5feffffff019b011d0d0000000024050403000000cc1b04030001011504575dc6ae7484c83c0dc97a4218f88e2cbe9b659c7552960d006e960d000000000000000000000000\n```\nand your command will show a result similar to this example:\n```json\n4a5202327e6ed2ce20d3b146155ec92e52fae6c4481362faf6f8a072017b41f1\n```\nThe result of this command is the TXID of the coins moving out of your b-address. You can monitor the progress in your wallet or look up the TXID in the [explorer](https://explorer.verus.io).\n\nnote: The above command and its result are examples. ***DO NOT*** use data from it. Use the results from your own wallet!\n\nSome words of advice after succesfully removing funds locked in a b-address:\n* Pay attention to which addresses you send.\n* It may be an idea to import the addresses you use into a fresh wallet, omitting all unused (b-) addresses.\n\nnote: Created 2020-11-11 by Oink.vrsc@",
