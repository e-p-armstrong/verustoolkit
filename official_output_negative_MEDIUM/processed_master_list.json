Alice@ effectively swaps the addresses that control Bob@.

You decide to create a \u201cpaper wallet\u201d to hold an address for the Alice@ ID. Because that address was created in a paper wallet, it\u2019s never exposed to the internet.

Bob@ has changed his address \u2014 he\u2019s moved houses! His new address contains his 1000 VRSC. The robbery is foiled and all Bob@\u2019s funds are safe.\nWhat if Bob@ was compromised electronically though? Those 1000 VRSC can be spent very quickly. You might not have time to revoke and recover Bob@\u2019s primary authority. Other powers are needed.\nAccounting for Time\nThe Verus protocol allows an ID to be locked or unlocked.

These practices are a zero-sum arbitrage exploit that can be used to gain an advantage by reducing latency or optimizing gas price strategies.", ", and sub-optimal slippage on price discovery.\nThe Smart Contract VM Model\nPrior to Komodo and Verus, smart contract enabled blockchains have used the state machine VM model where the blockchain acts as one giant world computer on which various contracts are \u201crun\u201d. This has been realized as a system of ordered actions/transactions simulating discrete events on a timeline, executed serially, in order, which is controlled by the miner. For liquidity pools and their users, this means that, within a block, one transaction or another will be the first to be processed (usually determined by order, and selected from all possible transactions by latency or gas prices paid), while others follow, in order. In serial processing, the order of the sequenced transactions has important implications for the fair and efficient use of liquidity.\nFront-running is traditionally viewed as predatory market behavior and is endemic on Ethereum-based systems where transactions and contracts submitted to the network are public, and queue-jumping can take place. As described in the well-known 2019 paper Flash Boys 2.0 there is inevitably a race to be the \u201cnext trade\u201d, and the entire platform becomes dominated by a zero sum game to optimally position a transaction in the sequence, with advantage to the miners, who often defer, based on earnings opportunity, to the most sophisticated and well-financed players .\nLatency wars and gas price rigging are just two ways of manipulating the transaction sequence, a zero-sum arbitrage exploit. Advantage can be gained by reducing latency through better infrastructure; for example, by being in a better position in the network topology. Advantage also goes to traders/arbs who have worked out better gas price strategies, or have made deals with key miners.

I\u2019ve put together this update on Verus PBaaS reserves, and the state of community development at the present to help briefly explain some things.\nAt any time and for virtually any volume, Verus will be convertible in a fully automatic way between Verus and native fractional reserve currencies through simple transactions and PBaaS reserve protocols.\nVerus fractional reserve currencies will be the native currencies of Verus PBaaS chains that choose to share liquidity across the Verus ecosystem. All PBaaS blockchains that are launched as Verus fractional reserves will control a certain amount of Verus Coin on the Verus blockchain that will serve as the reserves for those chains. The reserves may represent 100%, 50%, or even 10% of the total market cap of a PBaaS blockchain.\nExplaining the details of how these fractional reserve currencies work is not the purpose of this update.

This enables apps to scale over any number of decentralized blockchains worldwide and leave the management of user databases and user data, as well as settings, signals, endpoints, etc. to the users themselves and the client apps they use to help them manage.\nBecause the currency and liquidity pool support is in the L1 protocol, we have been able to actually solve for and provide MEV-resistant (both intra and inter-block) AMMs as a primitive, available to all applications and users.\nPeople don\u2019t have to write basic liquidity and conversion protocols, which are just primitives, not apps.

Because it is permissionless, non-custodial and provable. We can:\nsend and receive ETH and ERC-20s to and from Verus and Ethereum\nsend and receive currencies launched on Verus to and from Ethereum\nconvert currencies through the bridge converter currency. Use on Ethereum as well as on Verus.

Accordingly, in order to counteract this, and to attract providers who are interested in self-rebalancing, Verus includes the already described conversion fees. At a minimum, these fees should be sufficient to counteract any impermanent loss. Also possible though, is the result that the conversion fees will exceed the impermanent loss experienced by a provider \u2014 this is because impermanent loss is not \u201cpermanent\u201d in the sense that it appears and disappears only insofar as conversion ratios diverge from those that prevailed when a provider acquired the multi-reserve currency.

Thank you to the incredible, active Verus community for coming together so promptly to cast your \u201cvote\u201d in favor of this listing!\nAbout Verus\nVerus offers the most advanced zero knowledge privacy available, VerusHash, the only hash algorithm that is credibly mineable on both CPUs and GPUs, 50% proof of work and 50% proof of stake with a groundbreaking nothing-at-stake solution for more security and less power consumption, and is one of the most double-spend resistant blockchains running. Although Verus Coin has native, extreme double-spend resistance, it layers Komodo dPoW notarization for even further 51% attack resistance.\nThe Verus Coin project also releases a GUI, multi-coin wallet that allows the sending and receiving of private messages, has built-in CPU mining and staking, client and system improvements on a regular cadence, pool software, lite mode servers, and will soon release a multi-coin mobile wallet. The Verus Coin Project developers are currently workin", "./raw_text_input_medium/STEX.com Lists VerusCoin $VRSC-2018-11-02 04:35:10"]]], [["User:: Hey, I've heard about this Sapling feature that lets you earn extra Verus coins by catching cheaters.
