            "You don't. In Verus, every dApp must create its own version of smart contracts to build the dApp. This is because Verus Smart Transactions don't require a single, unified contract. Instead, they use a fully functional, decentralized backend, which is the Internet of Value, including all its unlimited scale, connected systems and chains.",

All inputs, outputs, cross-chain imports, and even conversions are validated and in/out values of all currencies accounted for by consensus, just as native currency ins and outs are on single-currency blockchains.\nIdentities are a first class concept in the primitives available for dApps. They all support fully available, open, decentralized, user controlled authentication and authorization protocols, enabled by QR code or deep links and supportive of permission granting, ID provisioning/sale by the dApp, private/attested KYC and other services. These protocols can easily be bridged to OAuth or OpenID Connect via servers like Hydra, but used natively, they require no service provider between the service actually authenticating the user and the user themselves.\nEvery identity is multisig and has revocation and recovery capabilities. They are also transferable and can have rights bound into them in a provable manner via the contentmultimap.
