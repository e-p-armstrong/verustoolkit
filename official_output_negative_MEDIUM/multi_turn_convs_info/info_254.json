            "VerusHash 2.0 does not explicitly prevent FPGAs and GPUs from being used for mining. Instead, it leverages the advantages of modern CPUs, such as higher clock speeds, integrated internal ASICs, and on-chip memory, to run more efficiently. This approach leaves FPGAs and GPUs to find their own ways to achieve similar efficiencies.",

For example, modern CPUs have higher clock speeds than FPGAs, highly integrated internal ASICs, and on-chip memory, the fastest being it\u2019s L1 Cache.\nBy designing VerusHash 2.0 such that it utilizes each of these advantages to run more efficiently, any device without them needs to find other ways to get those same efficiencies. Rather than explicitly attempting to block FPGAs or GPUs from functioning on the algorithm, the approach simply goes all out in leveraging efficiencies that CPUs can bring to the table, leaving FPGAs and GPUs to fend for themselves in other ways.\nBringing Mining into Balance\nVerusHash 2.0 is a result of something much deeper at the roots of the Verus project and in the principles of the founders, developers and community of Verus itself. You guessed it, decentralization and understanding truly what it is, why it\u2019s important, and how to implement it effectively. Decentralization is the principle that allows us to participate in consensus without the need for a trusted third or centralized party. It allows the people to have a voice that matters and makes a difference. It\u2019s not just a technical term to toss around or stick on a project to get the ratings.\nWithin the Verus project, decentralization is a foundational principle upon which the project, its fair launch, the technology, and the Verus community is built. If some group comes along looking to centralize in order to gain an unfair advantage, then the entire Verus community, as proven with VerusHash 2.0, is going to work to counter that centralization effort, in order to continue supporting a state of balance that works f",

            "Is the Verus project focused on centralizing mining power in the hands of a few individuals or groups?",
            "No, the Verus project is actually founded on the principle of decentralization, which allows for participation in consensus without a trusted third or centralized party. The project's goal is to maintain a state of balance, where no single group or individual has an unfair advantage. The development of VerusHash 2.0 is a testament to this commitment to decentralization.",
