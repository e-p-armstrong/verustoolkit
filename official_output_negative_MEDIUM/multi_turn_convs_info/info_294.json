            "How does VerusHash 2.0 favor GPU mining over CPU mining?",
            "VerusHash 2.0 does not favor GPU mining over CPU mining. In fact, it is designed to equalize GPU performance with CPUs, making CPUs viable miners on the Verus Coin network. The community's early results with GPUs, before optimization, suggest that even if FPGAs are 20x more efficient than GPUs, CPUs will still remain viable miners.",
            "or everyone and which continues to favor decentralization.\nWhat Verus has achieved, with early numbers already in, is the creation of the first ever mining algorithm to fully equalize GPU performance with CPUs. There is still a great deal of optimization work in progress on GPUs in the community, but it is pretty clear that for VerusHash 2.0, GPUs will not dominate CPUs. The numbers on FPGAs are not in yet, as no one to my knowledge has completed an FPGA mining algorithm that works.\nThe results the community is seeing with GPUs, before optimization, strongly indicate that FPGAs, even if 20x more efficient than GPUs, will also not prevent CPUs from remaining viable miners on the Verus Coin network. Two FPGA companies have already expressed that they are working on implementation of the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm, so the great news is that VerusHash 2.0 is likely to also be the first ever field-proven solution to effective hardware equalization across current generations of today\u2019s best mining solutions.\nMine Your Own Verus Today!\nWant to start earning Verus with your PC?

            "Is it possible to start mining Verus with a high-end GPU, but not with a single CPU?",
            "No, that's not correct. According to Verus, you can start earning Verus with your PC, even with a single CPU, within minutes. The community is designed to be accessible to casual miners and pros alike, and you can start mining Verus with minimal hardware requirements.",

            "That's not true. While the numbers on FPGAs are not in yet, two FPGA companies have already expressed interest in implementing the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm.
