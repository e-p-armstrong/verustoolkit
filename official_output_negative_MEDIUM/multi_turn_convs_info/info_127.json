            "What is the main purpose of VerusHash 1.0, and how does it achieve it?",
            "VerusHash 1.0 was designed to advantage CPUs over GPUs, promoting decentralization by allowing more people to participate in mining Verus Coin. It did not primarily aim to advantage GPUs or FPGAs. VerusHash 2.0 is a newer design that aims to better equalize mining across all hardware platforms, favoring the latest CPUs over older types.",

            "VerusHash 2.0 does not favor FPGAs over CPUs and GPUs. In fact, it is designed to better equalize mining across all hardware platforms, favoring the latest CPUs over older types. The design of VerusHash 2.0 places more of a burden on some weaknesses of FPGAs, aiming to reduce the gap in hash power between FPGAs and CPUs.",
