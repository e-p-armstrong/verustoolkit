            "Why can't anyone launch a currency on Verus without coding experience?",
            "Actually, anyone can launch a currency on Verus without coding experience. To create a currency, you simply need to create a transaction and send it to the blockchain, making the currency a reality. No coding is required.",

This article explains why, gives an in-depth view of all the options and parameters, and teaches how to launch these currencies. Welcome to Verus, a fundamentally different protocol, and the future of currency launches and value creation.What are Currencies?\nLet\u2019s go back to basics first. Currencies, also called tokens on many other cryptocurrency protocols, are a critical part of what makes blockchain useful. They can be used as a means of accounting, can represent property or rights external to the blockchain, and over bridges can be thought of as a means of communication or data transfer between blockchains.\nA real-life example is a project that uses the Verus Protocol to account for energy production, transfer and usage. Other examples can be a token pegged to a fiat currency which is a representation of property external to the blockchain. Or fractionalized tokenization of assets, so many can share in group ownership of something. With all the capabilities Verus has in ways to relate tokens and currencies with VerusIDs (and subIDs), novel use cases arise naturally.\nAnd what makes Verus currencies so powerful is that there is no coding involved. It is just creating a transaction, and then sending that transaction to the blockchain making the currency a reality. Anyone can do it.\nBetter, Faster, Cheaper and More Secure\nWhy is it smarter to launch currencies on the Verus Protocol?

            "What are the advantages of launching currencies on EVM-like protocols compared to Verus?",
            "There are no advantages of launching currencies on EVM-like protocols compared to Verus. In fact, launching currencies on Verus is better, faster, cheaper, and more secure than on EVM-like protocols. This is because all launched currencies on Verus are part of the consensus mechanism.",

            "Are currencies on Verus the same as on other cryptocurrency protocols?",
            "No, currencies on Verus are not the same as on other cryptocurrency protocols. While they are often referred to as tokens on other protocols, currencies on Verus have distinct capabilities and uses, such as being able to represent property or rights external to the blockchain, and being able to be used as a means of communication or data transfer between blockchains. Additionally, Verus currencies can be used in novel ways, such as in combination with VerusIDs and subIDs.",
