            "How does the Verus Coin Foundation benefit from the mining and staking process on the Verus blockchain?",
            "The Verus Coin Foundation does not benefit from the mining and staking process on the Verus blockchain. In fact, all fees are 100% recycled through mining and staking, creating value for the people who maintain the network, without any founder fees or developer fees going to the Verus Coin Foundation.",
            "Value for Miners & Stakers: Economy of the Verus Protocol\nSince Verus is an open, borderless and decentralised blockchain project, it is important to create value for the people who maintain the network; the miners and stakers. No value whatsoever goes to the Verus Coin Foundation, either through founder fees or developer fees. All fees are 100% recycled through mining and staking to create the groundwork for a thriving economy.\nMining and Staking VRSC\nIf a miner or staker on the Verus blockchain wins the competition to generate a new block, this is what\u2019s included:\nBlock reward of 24 VRSC (Halving to 12 VRSC takes place at block #1,278,000 [see halving countdown], with another halving every 1,051,920 blocks)\nVerusID: 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100 VRSC (What is paid to the miner or staker is dependent on referrals when creating a VerusID)\nConversion fee of 0.025% (This is the cost of converting to and from reserve currencies, paid in the currencies of the conversions)\nTransaction fees of 0.0001 VRSC (For every transaction happening on the chain)\nMerge-Mining\nMiners of the Verus blockchain can choose to mine up to 22 other chains, simultaneously, created in the PBaaS ecosystem, without losing any of the hashing power if you were to only mine Verus. This practically multiplies your CPU or GPU power by 22! This process is called Merge-Mining and is available to everyone. When Merge-Mining and staking you can earn the following:\nBlock rewards of 22 other chains\nNotarization fees in VRSC (To make chances higher that you will mine a chain, creators can choose to add VRSC to the block rewards)\nAdditionally, you can stake as many coins as you want in the PBaaS ecosystem.",
