            "Why did the Verus protocol allow the security incident at Roll to happen, and what measures are being taken to prevent it in the future?",
            "The Verus protocol did not allow the security incident at Roll to happen. The incident occurred because of a security breach at Roll, which was unrelated to Verus. Verus is a separate platform that offers a more secure and decentralized way of handling social tokens.",
            " Unfortunately, a security incident at Roll led to these \u201cescrowed\u201d amounts being stolen and liquidated.\nSocial tokens might be tied to entire groups, rather than a single influencer. In this case, Verus protocols allow multisignature approvals for the issuance or sale of the tokens. Multisigs can be up to 13 of 25 different participants.\nFinally, Verus testnet currently includes a provable decentralized bridge to and from the ethereum network. This bridge allows any token created on the Verus network to be bridged to ethereum, where it *automatically* emerges as an ERC-20 token, without any additional programming required. This is a crucial element, as ethereum is currently where the users are. Once created on Verus, an influencer can bridge tokens over to ethereum, where it can be used for giveaways, liquidity provision, or any other purpose for which social tokens are used today by Roll or Rally. Similarly, tokens can be bridged from ethereum, meaning that USDC, ETH, WBTC and other valuable currencies will exist on the Verus mainnet.\nStatus\nThese protocols exist now on the Verus testnet and are scheduled for imminent release to the Verus main network. As a community project, and FOSS project focused on core protocol development as a public good, Verus community members have not yet advanced consumer-ready tooling and apps that can take full advantage of these core capabilities. Nevertheless, forward-thinking influencers can start now, since experimentation is inexpensive, permissionless and easy, and some of the tooling and apps do exist for capable users. More importantly though, there is a business opportunity here for companies or entrepreneurs to leapfrog Roll and Rally, or for those companies themselves to pivot to, or supplement their current offerings with, a more capable rent-free platform. The Verus community stands by to assist anyone who would develop to",
