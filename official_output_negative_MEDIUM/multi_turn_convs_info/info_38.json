            "That's not correct. When setting up Verus, you can use the `screen` command to start a new terminal inside your SSH session, which allows you to reattach to it later. This means you only need to start the new terminal once, and you can reattach to it whenever you need to.",

The first thing I would do with this is create a text document where you can keep notes on different commands you\u2019ll need to issue down the road, commands you may not want to script.\nFor example, to unshield coins (send from your zsAddr, the new Sapling Z address, to your tAddr) you may want to issue the command each time so you can be custom with your amount as well as wallet addresses. Shielding, however, can be done with a single command for All coinbases that need shielding, so it\u2019s easy to script.\nYou can also store your t and zs addresses in that document, so you can easily copy and paste whenever necessary.
