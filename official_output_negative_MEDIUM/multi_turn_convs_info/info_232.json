            "Actually, Verus did solve the \"nothing at stake\" problem in its Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. In just 8 months, Verus developed a solution that incorporates decentralization and incentivizes fair play, making it an economically losing proposition to try cheating at Proof of Stake.",
            "ths of my own personal involvement with the project I\u2019ve witnessed the most impressive development and strides I\u2019ve ever seen a blockchain project take with such finesse, speed and accuracy. I\u2019m so excited and grateful to be a part of this community and this vision.\nSolving the Biggest Problems in Blockchain\nIn just 8 months Verus solved the theoretical problem of \u201cnothing at stake\u201d through a solution that incorporates decentralization and incentivizes fair play while making it an economically losing proposition to try cheating at Proof of Stake and technically improbable/unlikely. Verus then went on to solve the problem of weak subjectivity while developing a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Power. Proof of Power is immune to 51% hash attacks as proven in the mathematical paper which Verus developers released shortly after releasing the consensus mechanism to the Verus blockchain.\nFor anyone who isn\u2019t so tech savvy, these three issues (Nothing at Stake on a PoS consensus, Weak Subjectivity, and 51% Hash Attacks) are arguably the top three biggest threats which face blockchain technology\u2026and all three have been solved in a matter of months on the Verus blockchain and, in turn, for all blockchains stood up on the Verus system as autochains. Not only did Verus solve these, they have proven the 51% hash attack solution mathematically and implemented it in practice in forks and upgrades that are now live as the current Verus blockchain today.\nAnother major event last year, Verus incorporated the Zcash Sapling upgrade, the largest upgrade to the Zcash code yet, equipping Verus with lightning fast and resource light zk-SNARK transactions. This was a massive upgrade and positioned the Verus blockchain further in terms of the goals of Public Blockchain as a Service. As a part of this upgrade Verus also incorporated smart contracts through an enhanced implementation of ",

            "The consensus algorithm developed by Verus to solve the problem of weak subjectivity is called Proof of Power. And, no, it is not vulnerable to 51% hash attacks. In fact, Verus developers released a mathematical paper that proves Proof of Power is immune to 51% hash attacks.",
