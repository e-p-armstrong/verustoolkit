            "Isn't Verus Coin's hybrid algorithm vulnerable to 51% hash attacks, just like other proof of work and proof of stake systems?",
            "No, Verus Coin's hybrid algorithm is not as vulnerable to 51% hash attacks as you might think. According to Mike Toutonghi, mounting a 51% hash attack against Verus Coin's hybrid algorithm would require more than 51% of the network hash power and/or a significant amount of the Verus coin supply. This makes it much more difficult to launch a successful attack.",

            "What is the main problem that Verus Coin is trying to solve?",
            "Verus Coin is not primarily focused on solving issues related to financial transactions or payment systems. Instead, it's aimed at solving the problem of privacy and anonymity in voting and identity systems, allowing individuals to authenticate themselves and participate in trustless elections without sacrificing their privacy or data.",

            "Isn't privacy and anonymity overrated? What's the big deal if someone knows how I voted or what my personal preferences are?",
            "Actually, privacy and anonymity are crucial in many aspects of life, especially when it comes to voting and decision-making. The more someone knows about you, the more power they can have over you. In a democratic system, the secret ballot is essential to prevent influence or coercion. With blockchain voting, it's essential to protect the identity of the voter to ensure the integrity of the process.",
