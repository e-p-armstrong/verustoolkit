            "The Stake Guard Crypto Condition script does not evaluate a spend transaction when a cheater tries to spend their block reward before 100 blocks. In fact, the script only evaluates the spend transaction after 100 blocks when any block reward is spent. At that point, it checks for one of two conditions: whether the spend is being signed by the Public Key which staked it, or whether proof is presented in the OP_RETURN that this is a cheater's block reward.",

And the cheater\u2019s one valid block reward is able to be taken by anyone who sees it and spends it at block maturity.\nAfter 100 blocks when any block reward is spent, it passes through the Stake Guard Crypto Condition script which evaluates the spend transaction for 1 of 2 things:\nCondition a \u2014 Is this spend being signed by the Public Key which staked it?\nCondition b \u2014 Is proof presented in the OP_RETURN that this is a cheater\u2019s block reward?\n Result\u2014 Depending on one of the two conditions being met, Stake Guard will validate or reject the spend.\nCondition a: if a normal staker is trying to shield their stake reward, their public key is being passed automatically to Stake Guard which compares it to the public key in the meta data of the stake transaction on the blockchain. They match, so it signs it as normal and the staker has their reward.\nCondition b: if the public key of the spender does NOT match the original staker public key, Stake Guard verifies that the cheat transaction proof has been submitted in the OP_RETURN.\nThe proof of a cheated transaction, the data bits packed up from that duplicate stake transaction which the Cheat Hunter found, is passed in an OP_RETURN and the Stake Guard CC evaluates and confirms that it is indeed a verifiable cheated transaction. It does this by comparing the matching UTXOs of the legitimate and cheated staking transactions, their respective previous block heights, and their respective block heights at the time they were generated.
