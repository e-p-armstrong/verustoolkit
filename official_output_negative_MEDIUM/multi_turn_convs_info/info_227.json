            "How do I use the \"initialsupply\" parameter to allocate funds to specific VerusIDs after the currency is launched?",
            "The \"initialsupply\" parameter is not used to allocate funds to specific VerusIDs after the currency is launched. Instead, it's used to set the initial supply of a basket currency during the preconversion time frame, before the currency is launched. People who preconvert into the reserves receive from this initial supply. If you want to allocate funds to specific VerusIDs after the currency is launched, you should use the \"preallocations\" parameter.",
