            "What's the consensus algorithm used in Verus, and does it rely solely on Proof of Work?",
            "Verus doesn't rely solely on Proof of Work. Its consensus algorithm is based on Proof of Power (Verus PoP), which is a 50\u201350 split of Proof of Stake and Proof of Work. This hybrid solution provides a provable solution to 51% hash attacks and solves the \"nothing at stake\" and \"weak subjectivity\" issues that are common in other PoS systems.",

            "Is it possible to launch a fully mineable, secure tokenized blockchain with Verus, but only if you have extensive coding knowledge?",
            "No, with Verus, you don't need extensive coding knowledge to launch a fully mineable, secure tokenized blockchain. The Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) feature allows anyone, including communities, governments, organizations, or individuals, to launch a blockchain with just a few clicks, without requiring much coding knowledge.",
