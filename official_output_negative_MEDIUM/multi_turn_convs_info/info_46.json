            "Do conversion fees in Verus's self-rebalancing portfolios benefit liquidity providers by covering their impermanent loss, but not generating any additional yield?",
            "No, that's not correct. Conversion fees in Verus's self-rebalancing portfolios are designed to counteract impermanent loss, and may even exceed the impermanent loss experienced by a provider. This means that liquidity providers may enjoy conversion fees that were generated along the way, even when impermanent loss disappears. This can be seen as a form of \"yield farming\".",
