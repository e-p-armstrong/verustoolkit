            "Can you explain how easy it is for anyone to create a social token on Roll and Rally, without needing any technical expertise?",
            "Actually, creating a social token on Roll and Rally is not as straightforward as you might think. Both platforms require creators to go through a detailed application process, and then wait for approval. This means that creators need to provide evidence of a significant community size, transaction activity, and a clear understanding of how the social token economy will fit into their projects. Additionally, creators who want to \"do it themselves\" without using Roll or Rally's services face an arduous and limiting process, requiring decent development skills to get their tokens up and running.",

            "How do Roll and Rally allow creators to create social tokens without taking a portion of the token or benefiting from the token's success in any way?",
            "That's not exactly true. Roll's business model involves taking a portion of the creator's token for themselves. Rally's model is a bit more complex, but they also benefit from the token's success by creating value in their own token and sidechain. This is because there is significant engineering and other work required to get the contracts up and running that define the social token and provide it liquidity.",
