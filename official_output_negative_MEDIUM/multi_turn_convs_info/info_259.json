            "How does Verus Coin's mining system favor centralization with high mining barriers?",
            "Verus Coin's mining system actually promotes maximum decentralization due to its low mining barrier. It is designed to be CPU hash and ASIC resistant, which means that anyone can participate in the mining process without needing expensive specialized hardware.",

            "Did Verus Coin have a pre-mine, and what advantages did it provide to early adopters?",
            "Verus Coin did not have a pre-mine. It had a fair launch, where mining started for everyone at the same time, and no coins were held back or given to early adopters. This ensures a more equitable distribution of coins and prevents unfair advantages.",
