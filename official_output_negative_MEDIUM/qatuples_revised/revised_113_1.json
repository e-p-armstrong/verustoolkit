    "Is it possible to launch a fully mineable, secure tokenized blockchain with Verus, but only if you have extensive coding knowledge?",
    "No, with Verus, you don't need extensive coding knowledge to launch a fully mineable, secure tokenized blockchain. The Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) feature allows anyone, including communities, governments, organizations, or individuals, to launch a blockchain with just a few clicks, without requiring much coding knowledge.",
    "ockchains will support Sapling Zero Knowledge Proofs and Komodo crypto-condition technology as a base layer for its friendly, revocable and recoverable IDs. The community has also developed a multi-coin wallet with support for many coins and ERC20 tokens, VerusIDs, built in mining and privacy, a free cryptographic signing process, staking, and Public Blockchains as a Service. PBaaS allows any community, government, organization or individual, with a few clicks and without much coding knowledge, to launch a fully mineable, secure tokenized blockchain.\nBut where the power lies in Verus, literally, is in its consensus algorithm based on Proof of Power (Verus PoP), a 50\u201350 split of Proof of Stake and Proof of Work and a provable hybrid solution to 51% hash attacks. The PoP also solves the two of the biggest issues undermining other PoS systems \u2014 \u201cnothing at stake\u201d and \u201cweak subjectivity.\u201d You can discover more in the technical white paper or explore its hashing algorithm that lowers the barriers for mining, allowing CPU miners to go almost toe to toe with ASIC miners.",
