    "Why does the Verus community not have any contributors who have made significant contributions to the project?",
    "Actually, the Verus community has many contributors who have made significant contributions to the project. Several individuals, including Mike Toutonghi, Michael Toutonghi Jr, David Dawes, Asher Dawes, Alex English, JL777, Godballz, and many others, have participated and contributed to the project in various ways. The community is an evolving decentralized ecosystem of participants working together toward the Verus vision.",
    " to each and every one. I want to mention just a few of those who I\u2019ve noted some significant participation, contribution, in some way.\nMike Toutonghi\nMichael Toutonghi Jr\nDavid Dawes\nAsher Dawes\nAlex English\nJL777\nGodballz\nChris \u2014 LOUD Mining Dev-Ops\n0x03\nGinasis Mining Pools\nKryptoshi\nAelder\nPaia\nGrewalsatinder\nRunningwithbeer\nMeyse\nRegnar\nStretcher83\nMammothine\nBitopia\nHellcatz\nIf I left anyone out I\u2019m sorry! Know that I\u2019m deeply appreciative to every fellow community member!\nResonating with Something Deeper\nWith the innovative and, dare I say brilliant, development work by lead developer Mike Toutonghi as another community contributor able to deliver quality, working and revolutionary code and solutions swiftly and smoothly..and a host of talented developers, committed contributors, miners, stakers\u2026the Verus community is an evolving decentralized ecosystem of participants working together toward the Verus vision and building a bright and thriving future society, economy and integral implementations of blockchain technology within, in my opinion, the most secure, well grounded, and best-suited blockchain system yet seen in the industry.\nFor me it is exactly the sort of project I\u2019ve been looking for, it resonates with my philosophies of decentralization, with my principles of privacy, with my own desire and vision of a society which is better equipped for supporting freedom, privacy, truth, voice, and positive economy in which people are able to be in control of their own identity, money, opinions, time, and attention.\nIt is, in my opinion, the next logical step for Bitcoin and in total sync and alignment with the original Bitcoin whitepaper and Satoshi himself.\nAs I\u2019ve grown to learn more about the Verus vision, understand the tech better, and spend time with the other Verus contributors, including Mike and other devs, my passion and love for this project continue ",
