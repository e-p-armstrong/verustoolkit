    "Don't social tokens require a lot of programming and engineering effort to create?",
    "No, that's not the case. Experiments to prove the concepts of social tokens on Verus require no programming, are risk-free, and extremely low cost. The core protocols already exist, and tooling and apps can be built out through a collective effort.",
    "s a reality now, offering more functionality, to more people \u2014 smart contract platforms cannot match these capabilities today absent an enormous engineering effort in bringing together multiple interoperating complex smart contracts\nadditional capabilities include privacy enhancement, moral hazard resistance, easy group dynamics\nprovable decentralized bridges to ethereum give the best of both worlds \u2014 intelligent next generation social tokens that can also emerge automatically, without programming, as ERC-20s\nexperiments to prove these concepts require no programming, are risk-free and extremely low cost \u2014 core protocols exist now, tooling and apps still require build-out in a collective effort\nSocial Tokens \u2014 the Promise\nGoogling the term \u201csocial tokens\u201d brings a host of articles discussing socal tokens as the next big thing. The idea has been around for a while since ERC-20s mainstreamed the idea of token creation riding on top of a base layer blockchain. Creating digital scarcity and expressing that as a transferable token was now possible without creating an independent blockchain; it could be done at relatively low cost and with low maintenance. Soon, people began thinking about tokens where an influencer, brand or community creates a branded token, pre-mines a little bit of it, gets their fan-base/customers/community to transact in it and, presto, the token will start to gain a little bit of value.\nThe First Generation\nEarly market leaders soon arrived, such as tryroll.com and rally.io. These platforms are well-funded venture businesses that managed to onboard perhaps thousands of creators into their own social tokens. Despite some fanfare though, there\u2019s not much to these tokens other than\nenforced digital scarcity \u2014 they help creators create and issue ERC-20s (or Solana now, for Rally), helping them through what is an otherwise arduous process requiring some s",
