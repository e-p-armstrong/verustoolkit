    "How can I mix older \"Sprout\" addresses and \"Sapling\" addresses in the same transaction?",
    "You cannot mix older \"Sprout\" addresses and \"Sapling\" addresses in the same transaction. According to the Sapling upgrade rules, if you have Verus Coin that you would like to move from an older Sprout z-address to a Sapling z-address, you must first send it to a transparent address, then to the Sapling z-address.",
    " cheats on the network.\nAt this point with this release it is now statistically a losing proposition to cheat. In Verus 0.4.0+ you are now statistically more likely to generate more rewards by not cheating.\nStaking the same wallet/coins on more than one computer creates the possibility that you will stake on two forks with the same coins, which puts your earnings at risk as it can create \u201ccheated stakes\u201d, so you should not stake the same address/wallet on more than a single computer at any one time.\nLearn more about StakeGuard and Verus \u201cNothing at Stake\u201d solution here:\nHow Verus Solved Nothing at Stake and Weak Subjectivity Proof of Stake Problems\nFrom \u2018Nothing at Stake\u2019 to \u2018No Incentive to Cheat\u2019 \u2014 Innovating Proof of Stake on the Verus PoS+PoW Hybrid Blockchainmedium.com\nStake Delegation\nIn the new Verus network protocol that activates at the same time as Sapling, you can now set the parameter -pubkey in the command line wallet, which will redirect both mining AND staking rewards to the public key of an address, which can be obtained from an address with the \u201cvalidatekey\u201d command.\nVerus 0.4.0 GUI Improvements\nPerformance on large wallets is significantly improved\nSorting of all columns now works properly\nSeparate controls for mining and staking\nSapling Activation\nVerus Coin 0.4.0 includes support for Sapling addresses and transactions, including memory usage reduction of near 98% and performance improvements over previous z-transactions typically 40\u201350x.\nAs with Zcash Sapling upgrade rules, older \u201cSprout\u201d addresses and \u201cSapling\u201d addresses may not be mixed in the same transaction. That means if you have Verus Coin that you would like to move from an older Sprout z-address to a Sapling z-address, you must first send it to a transparent address, then to the Sapling z-address.\nSapling addresses can be used for shielding coinbase transactions or other functions.
