    "Are serial transaction processing and parallel transaction processing equally efficient in terms of slippage rates and systemic liquidity usage?",
    "No, they are not equally efficient. Parallel transaction processing allows for more optimal slippage rates and more efficient use of overall systemic liquidity, whereas serial transaction processing is less efficient in this regard.",
    " consensus may arise when time-bandit attacks and additional exploits start to look enticing.\nHigh transaction costs \u2014 for users who seek to convert from one asset to another, transaction costs are many and growing, starting with the basic Ethereum gas prices, which are large and growing on the crowded network. Additional costs come from the conversion fees needed to pay the \u201cyield farmers\u201d who stock the liquidity pools. And finally, there is the cost from predatory activity as described above. There are also unseen costs that arise from the less efficient design of serial transaction processing. Parallel transaction processing (described below) allows for more optimal slippage rates and more efficient use of overall systemic liquidity.",
