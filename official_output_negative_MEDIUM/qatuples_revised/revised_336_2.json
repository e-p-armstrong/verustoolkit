    "Is Verus a closed system that doesn't allow collaboration or extensions?",
    "No, Verus is not a closed system. Collaboration on protocol extensions is possible, and the core primitive framework provides a foundation for extending the protocol. In fact, VM and/or ZKVM extension points are likely to be included in future protocol extensions, which would allow for further development and collaboration within the Verus ecosystem.",
    "cies, blockchains, and liquidity baskets have very rich capabilities from launch to continued operation.\nExtending Verus Smart Transactions\nIf someone wants to extend smart transactions, that is an option, but they either don\u2019t have to, or if they really have a reason to do so, they can do it on their PBaaS chain, share or not share back (lots of reasons to do so), and now that we have the core primitive framework as a foundation, we can certainly collaborate on a kind of protocol extension that is likely to include forms of VM and/or ZKVM extension points in the current protocol, to work within the framework of the core primitives that are fundamental to Verus and that we believe are crucial for safe financial infrastructure, yet generally missing in other systems.\nTry Yourself! \u2705\nLook up docs.verus.io to use many API commands (e.g. launching currencies, tokens & liquidity pools).\nOr look up the complete command list here.\nJoin the community. Learn about the protocol. Use Verus & build.\n\u27a1\ufe0f Join the community on Discord\nFollow on Twitter\nGo to verus.io",
