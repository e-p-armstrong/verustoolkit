    "What's the consensus algorithm used in Verus, and does it rely solely on Proof of Work?",
    "Verus doesn't rely solely on Proof of Work. Its consensus algorithm is based on Proof of Power (Verus PoP), which is a 50\u201350 split of Proof of Stake and Proof of Work. This hybrid solution provides a provable solution to 51% hash attacks and solves the \"nothing at stake\" and \"weak subjectivity\" issues that are common in other PoS systems.",
    "ockchains will support Sapling Zero Knowledge Proofs and Komodo crypto-condition technology as a base layer for its friendly, revocable and recoverable IDs. The community has also developed a multi-coin wallet with support for many coins and ERC20 tokens, VerusIDs, built in mining and privacy, a free cryptographic signing process, staking, and Public Blockchains as a Service. PBaaS allows any community, government, organization or individual, with a few clicks and without much coding knowledge, to launch a fully mineable, secure tokenized blockchain.\nBut where the power lies in Verus, literally, is in its consensus algorithm based on Proof of Power (Verus PoP), a 50\u201350 split of Proof of Stake and Proof of Work and a provable hybrid solution to 51% hash attacks. The PoP also solves the two of the biggest issues undermining other PoS systems \u2014 \u201cnothing at stake\u201d and \u201cweak subjectivity.\u201d You can discover more in the technical white paper or explore its hashing algorithm that lowers the barriers for mining, allowing CPU miners to go almost toe to toe with ASIC miners.",
