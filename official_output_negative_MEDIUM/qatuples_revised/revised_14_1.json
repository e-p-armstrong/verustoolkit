    "Title: Verus\u200a\u2014\u200aSuperior DeFi for Community Driven Liquidity\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-superior-defi-for-community-driven-liquidity-e2592b251146\nContent:Verus \u2014 Superior DeFi for Community Driven Liquidity\nSimultaneous parallel processing of DeFi transactions allows Verus to advance the technology underpinning automated market makers and community liquidity. The result is a series of improvements including lower costs, optimization of liquidity, and new benefits to users.The power of automated market makers and liquidity pools is a recently growing phenomenon, which so far has only been explored primarily within the VM models of Ethereum/EOS/Tron.\nThe VM model is based on serial processing of ordered transactions, solving each transaction one after the other after the other, etc..\nVerus is an UTXO-based blockchain using smart transactions which are essentially smart contracts written into the protocol.\nThe Verus model allows for parallel processing of all transactions within a block simultaneously, allowing new paradigms for community driven liquidity.\nParallel processing saves users costs by reducing slippage, eliminating front-running, eliminating risks from faulty smart contracts and unintended consequences.\nParallel processing also allows for the fairest prices without mind to latency or gas price rigging, as well as novel investment vehicles, new approaches to arbitrage, and better use of all existing liquidity in a system.\nVerus DeFi is conducted by smart \u201csend transactions\u201d on Verus blockchains any of which may include multi-chain capabilities; this means chain transaction costs are kept as low as possible or new, less expensive chains can take the traffic, and scalability is practically unlimited.\nThe Verus community believes that community driven liquidity does not need to be driven entirely by yield farming, but that ample liquidity will",
