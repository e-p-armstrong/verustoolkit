    "The main purpose of the \"Stake Guard\" Crypto-Condition in Verus is to solve the \"Nothing at Stake\" and \"Weak Subjectivity\" problems facing Proof of Stake. It makes it a losing proposition to cheat, providing a decentralized solution to these issues.",
    "g to add mobile staking, public blockchains as a service (PBaaS), and polls and voting applications for scalable, public use. On top of all this, Verus was a 100% fair, no-ICO, no-pre-mine community launch.\nAn Important Listing at an Important Milestone\nThis listing comes on the heels of activating Sapling and implementing the new Crypto-Condition \u201cStake Guard\u201d which, in conjunction with Cheat Catcher, is a blockchain-level decentralized solution to \u201cNothing at Stake\u201d for Proof of Work. In addition to solving Nothing at Stake and Weak Subjectivity theoretical problems, Verus also notarizes to the Komodo blockchain through \u201cdelayed Proof of Work\u201d or dPoW. This notarization is similar to taking a snapshot backup of the Verus chain and \u201csaving it\u201d to the KMD blockchain. Komodo, in turn, notarizes to the most secure blockchain in the world\u2026presently Bitcoin.\nMilestones Being Realized\nOn October 30, at block height 227520, Verus activated an enhanced implementation of Sapling, the upgrade developed by Zcash. This upgrade changes how Shielded zk-SNARK transactions operate, introduces new address styles, and some additional advancements to Zero Knowledge privacy. To put it simply, the process of performing totally private zk-SNARK transactions, in new Sapling edition of Verus, is like going from Dial-up to Fiber overnight. Read more about Sapling here.\nIn addition to these important advancements, Verus also activated enhancements in how transactions are handled including the development of Verus\u2019 first Crypto-Condition called Stake Guard. Stake Guard is a decentralized solution to \u201cnothing at stake\u201d and \u201cweak subjectivity\u201d problems facing Proof of Stake, completely solving the problem by making it a losing proposition to cheat.\nAn important part of this solution is Cheat Catcher which can now be enabled on any node running in Native mode by either miners or stakers, and whic",
