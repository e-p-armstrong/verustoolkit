    "Can you explain how Michael Toutonghi's project is focused on creating a private blockchain infrastructure for corporations?",
    "Michael Toutonghi's project is not focused on creating a private blockchain infrastructure for corporations. Instead, his vision is to develop public blockchain infrastructure that can be used by the world, inspired by bitcoin's approach to re-imagining money. The goal is to provide people with a real chance of self-sovereignty and new ways to self-organize in many areas of life.",
    "nd hard to resist.\nOne of the best efforts to deal with convertibility in community currencies is the project Bancor. They pioneered onchain reserves as part of a currency\u2019s definition, dynamically expanding and retracting supply, tied to use, and the ability to convert directly to and from other currencies, using locked onchain reserves as a fractional backing. This proof of concept has existed since the first version of Bancor, as a smart contract capability on Ethereum. For any community, each particular implementation of a smart contract would need to be designed, engineered and audited by experts, in this case Bancor developers. But Bancor is a heavily funded venture business at root, having raised hundreds of millions of dollars in an ICO. Development of community currencies doesn\u2019t pay, unlike commercially-driven defi, so Bancor soon abandoned any focus in this area.\nAt about the same time as Bancor emerged, former Microsoft fellow Michael Toutonghi, and some associates, released a vision paper focused on making public blockchain infrastructure that can be used by the world. Inspired by bitcoin\u2019s approach to re-imagining money, they aimed for the development of usable blockchain primitives that could form the basis of distributed network applications that provide people a real chance of self-sovereignty and new ways to self-organize in many areas of life.\nThey began developing software and protocols, basing off Bitcoin and Zcash, and bootstrapped a worldwide network of self-interested miners and stakers who power a network that is capable of providing public blockchain infrastructure. Fast forward five years, and a good portion of the network has been running for years, providing the first parts of the system. Now, the rest of the full vision (and more) is about to transition from testnet to mainnet, and new capabilities for blockchain are about to become publi",
