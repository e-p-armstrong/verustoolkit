    "Does Verus's Stake Guard Crypto Condition allow double spending of stake rewards?",
    "No, Verus's Stake Guard Crypto Condition does not allow double spending of stake rewards. In fact, it ensures that only the legitimate stake reward can be spent when proven, and prevents cheated stake transactions from being spent. This is achieved through the use of a blockchain-level Crypto Condition that handles all staking transaction spends.",
    "ing CC transactions to act more like \u201cnormal\u201d transactions. With the modified CCs Verus is able to implement powerful functionality that extends the flexibility and resultant power of the Verus blockchain in preparation for PBaaS and the services which will be able to be coded into blockchains in the future.\nStake Guard is the first Verus Crypto Condition to be released and it\u2019s what solves the \u201cnothing at stake\u201d problem and performs the \u201cmagic\u201d.\nStake Guard \u2014 The Proof of Stake Crypto Condition\nThis new CC which Verus has developed and is adding to the blockchain, works in conjunction with a newly modified signing script when staking and spending a reward.\nThe result is a blockchain-level Crypto Condition which handles all staking transaction spends, either processing them as usual for normal shakers, or allowing any cheated stake transaction containing its stake block reward to be spent by anyone who can prove its indeed a cheaters stake. No double spending occurs at any point, to cheat the cheater had a real stake plus additional cheat attempts at any given block. Only the legitimate stake reward can be spent when proven.\nHere\u2019s how it works.\nWhen staking a new block, a new format of transaction called a Staking Transaction is generated. This transaction format is enforced and utilizes the Stake Guard at the minting of the new block. It contains more meta data, such as the public key of the staker who signed it, the UTXO, the block height, and previous block height.\nIf a cheater has tried to stake on more forks at the same block height, that cheat attempt is also recorded. Anyone scanning the blockchain can see it and verify that it\u2019s indeed a cheat attempt, as the data is there immutably and without the ability to manipulate things like UTXO or information about the blockchain at the time of the stake.\nFor the community, this is an opportunity of 100 blocks to loo",
