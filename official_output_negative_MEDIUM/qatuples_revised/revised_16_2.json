    "What is the primary reason for the system's instability and high slippage rates from block to block?",
    "There is no indication of the system being unstable or having high slippage rates. In fact, the system's architecture enables more stable slippage rates from block to block, due to the amplification of liquidity and the canceling out of transactions towards parity within a block.",
    " other traders can be entering the pool along with me during my block, system stability acts as if overall liquidity has been significantly amplified (relative to what is possible with serial processing). In other words, for a given level of liquidity in the pool, a user can expect more stable slippage rates from block to block. There are two primary reasons for this. Firstly, with all transactions in a block cancelling themselves out towards parity, there is a lower ratio of effective aggregate transaction size to aggregate liquidity, thus giving the appearance of greater liquidity. Secondly, because other users (converters) are in the block with me, system liquidity is enhanced by use, even if users intend only to use the multi-reserve currency as a point-to-point conversion, and not a destination in itself. In this way, liquidity begets liquidity \u2014 if a particular multi-reserve is bootstrapped with sufficient liquidity, it becomes attractive for users because they can convert in the fair, low slippage, ungamed, low cost environment. As users come, liquidity naturally increases, and the system becomes increasingly robust, thus attracting more users.\nHaving said this, the multi-reserves also serve as a liquidity destination in themselves. This is because the multi-reserves act as two different types of novel investment vehicles. First, they are a self-rebalancing portfolio with zero fees and dynamic rebalancing over 1000 times per day. An investor can, for example, choose to convert into a \u201cquad coin\u201d that is a multi-reserve currency that is backed by 25/25/25/25% of four different tokens (say, ETH, BTC, VRSC, USDT). Many sophisticated investors typically follow efficient portfolio theory and engage in occasional rebalancing. Usually done once a year, a quarter, or after sharp moves, rebalancing requires management oversight (thus costs or fees) and continuous transa",
