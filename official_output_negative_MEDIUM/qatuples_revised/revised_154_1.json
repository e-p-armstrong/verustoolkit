    "No, the Verus project is an open-source development project. It depends on open-source development to support the continued innovation of its technologies.",
    " of the currency, the Verus formal \u201cproof of burn\u201d allows this event to enable new kinds of licensing and use cases. One group is pioneering PPaaC, Patent Portfolios as a Commons, and mutualizing benefits from licensing the use of technologies, which has for years, been monopolized.\nPeople and businesses will be able to buy a specific currency to pay their patent license fees. For every device they license, they will pay the license fee from that currency by burning the prescribed amount and the license will be tied to that specific device. Before the currency goes live, people can \u2018pre-convert\u2019 coins to that currency, to get a discount on the licensing (they get the currency at a cheaper rate than the actual set rate).\nThis way the Verus blockchain provides a method of paying for the licenses (which is not new in itself) and a means of checking if the devices are licensed to use the patented technology (which is also not new in itself). The combination of payments and licensing checks on one platform is completely new though, and allows anyone to buy into the patent market as an investment in the network and concept.\nThe Road Ahead\nOnce testing is complete, the Verus release will be live on mainnet and the development team will continue to iterate on these innovations. The project is always open to more developers as it depends on open source development to support the continued innovation of these technologies.\nDespite the numerous innovations in this testnet release, blockchain technology and token engineering have a long road ahead. Having the new tools and capabilities of Verus will teleport the space light years ahead, but while the current focus thus far has been on a race to build \u201cthe best protocol,\u201d the next step in maturing the tech will be reflected in interoperability and systems modeling and engineering.\nMoving from a single chain mentality to blockchain",
