    "Are SubIDs only used for creating NFTs or public profiles in the Community Currency ecosystem?",
    "No, SubIDs are not limited to just creating NFTs or public profiles. They are multi-use friendly name \"identities\" that can be registered by community members by paying a set amount of CommCurr. SubIDs can be used for a wide range of digital goods, such as signaling support for the community, creating branded community-oriented names, representing physical items, or even serving as tickets or discount codes. The possibilities are virtually unlimited.",
    " CommCurr. They can choose to stagger escrows, making, say, 10% freely spendable now, and then unlocking 10% a year after that. One aspect to consider is that, if a lock is made irrevocable, it will build in capital cost risk for a community. Ie. if the experiment is a failure and there\u2019s no adoption, they wouldn\u2019t have access to their original capital until the unlock period passes.\nWait, There\u2019s More \u2014 Enhancing the Community Currency through New Capabilities for a Digital Goods Economy that Directly and Tangibly Benefits the Currency\nPossibly the most forward-thinking element of a Community Currency is the ability to build a real digital goods economy around it. The Verus protocols make this possible through the issuance of what are called SubIDs. SubIDs are multi-use friendly name \u201cidentities\u201d. Community members can register these names by paying a set amount of CommCurr, for example, 10 CommCurr per registration. This increases the value of CommCurr because any amounts paid for the \u201cidentities\u201d are burned, thus increasing the value of the currency for all holders thereof (including the original issuer).\nCommunity members might seek to register identities for many reasons:\nto signal support for the community\nto have a recognizable or branded community-oriented name to receive funds, eg. \u201cmember.CommCurr@\u201d\nto create a NFT or public profile attached to the name (\u201cidentities\u201d are capable of being expressed as nfts, artwork, public profiles, etc.)\nto be a ticket for an event or a discount code for purchases, or a membership in a club\nTo be attached to a physical item, like a community landmark, where it can represent a public profile or description, fundraiser, message board, etc.\nThese are just some of the virtually unlimited examples of digital goods that could be created, all of which would require CommCurr to acquire, this creating a real demand for the currency.\n",
