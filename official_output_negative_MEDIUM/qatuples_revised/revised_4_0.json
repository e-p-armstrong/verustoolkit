    "What is the purpose of the \"stop\" file in the unzipped folder?",
    "There is no \"stop\" file in the unzipped folder. The file that needs to be edited is the \"start\" file, which contains the configuration for mining Verus Coin. The \"start\" file needs to be customized with the pool Host and Port, Verus Coin public address, optional worker name, and the number of threads to use.",
    "Simply unzip the compressed folder to your Desktop or somewhere easy to access, then open the folder and use a text editor to edit the \u201cstart\u201d file within.\nStep 3\nCustomize the top section of the start script file with the pool Host and Port you\u2019ve decided to use, your Verus Coin public address you copied earlier, an optional \u201cworker name\u201d (useful if you are going to mine from many devices, so you can track how each is doing), and lastly, with a number representing how many \u201cThreads\u201d you want your system to mine with. You can find out how many threads your CPU has by doing a simple Google search.\nAfter entering the custom data into the start file, be sure to save it!Part 3 \u2014 Begin Mining!\nNow that you have your wallet and your start script is configured with it, along with the pool and thread settings, you\u2019re ready to mine! This part scares a lot of people, because you\u2019re running a \u201ccommand line\u201d script. But it\u2019s no sweat, I promise.\nStep 1\nOpen the folder containing the start script (or maybe it\u2019s still open) and, in Linux, right click inside the folder. From the drop down menu that appears, simply click \u201cOpen in Terminal\u201d. (In Windows simply open the folder containing the start.bat file.)\nOn a Mac, click Finder, Services, and select \u201cNew Terminal at Folder\u201d.\nStep 2\nNow simply run the start script!\nIn Windows you can simply double click the \u201cstart.bat\u201d file. Windows may give you a security warning, to bypass it click \u201cMore info\u201d and then \u201cRun Anyway\u201d. If you run into an error in Windows regarding a missing DLL, try installing the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 3.\nIn Mac and Linux you\u2019ll run the \u201cstart.sh\u201d script as follows:",
