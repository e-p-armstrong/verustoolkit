    "How do bridge hacks occur due to the lack of safeguards in the Verus-Ethereum Bridge?",
    "Actually, the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is designed with safeguards in place to prevent hacks. It's the prevailing cryptocurrency bridges in the industry that have been shown to be vulnerable to hacks due to their centralized nature and lack of safeguards. The Verus-Ethereum Bridge, on the other hand, uses a decentralized approach, with multiple parties involved in verifying and proving assets, making it more secure and resistant to hacks.",
    "ies from Verus to Ethereum as ERC-721 & ERC-1155.\nPresent Issues with Existing Cryptocurrency Bridges\nLet\u2019s first delve into the challenges associated with the prevailing cryptocurrency bridges in the industry.\nThe custody of bridged assets is typically maintained by a single or a small number of addresses, effectively creating a central authority for holding the funds, which contradicts the decentralized nature of blockchain.\nThe smart contracts that secure these bridged assets can be readily modified by a singular or limited number of authorities, thus presenting potential security issues.\nSmart contracts might contain bugs or malicious codes, making them susceptible to exploitation and undermining the safety of the bridged assets, especially if those assets are not accounted for by the block producers.\nThese problems have been demonstrated by numerous bridge hacks that have occurred and are likely to continue in the future. Verus does things, yet again, very different.\nWhy the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is Different\nThe Verus-Ethereum Bridge is different because the assets are never in anyone\u2019s custody. This is done through the seamless cooperation between the block producers, community notary witnesses, the Bridgekeeper software and the Ethereum smart contract. At each step during cross-chain transactions the assets are verified and proven by consensus rules, with safeguards in place to prevent hacks.\nEvery 10 blocks validators create a notarization. They create these digital receipts for both Verus and Ethereum. The digital receipts, called \u201cnotarizations\u2019\u2019, contain, among other things: the \u201cstateroot\u201d (Merkle Mountain Range for Verus, Merkle Patricia Trie for Ethereum), the blockheight, blockhash and the gas price for Ethereum. The notarizations have to be agreed to by the block producers (miners and stakers) and are then mined into the Verus blockchain.\n\ud83d\udc49 Read more ",
