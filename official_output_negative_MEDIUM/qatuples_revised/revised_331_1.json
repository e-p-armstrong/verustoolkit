    "What is the main advantage of Proof of Work (PoW) over Proof of Stake (PoS) in the context of Verus' hybrid blockchain?",
    "The text does not state that Verus considers Proof of Work (PoW) superior to Proof of Stake (PoS). In fact, Verus combines Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delayed Proof of Work in a hybrid blockchain, highlighting the benefits of a hybrid approach.",
    "Title: How Verus Solved Nothing at Stake and Weak Subjectivity Proof of Stake Problems\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-verus-solved-nothing-at-stake-and-weak-subjectivity-proof-of-stake-problems-b4dd6a85086e\nContent:How Verus Solved Proof of Stake\u2019s Two Biggest Problems: Nothing at Stake and Weak Subjectivity\nFrom \u2018Nothing at Stake\u2019 to \u2018No Incentive to Cheat\u2019 \u2014 Innovating Proof of Stake on the Verus PoS+PoW Hybrid BlockchainA Revolutionary Shift\nVerus, the CPU-minable community project which combines Proof of Work, Proof of Stake, and Delayed Proof of Work in a fork of Komodo, has just solved the biggest problems which threaten current Proof of Stake blockchains.\nMike Toutonghi, lead developer at Verus decided as a part of extending the capabilities of the Verus blockchain, to tackle the most famous theoretical problem threatening Proof of Stake blockchains: the Nothing at Stake problem.\nThe solution is so simple and elegant and built right into the Verus Blockchain.\nSet to be released in the upcoming upgrade to the Verus blockchain where Verus Sapling will also be released, this solution brings one of the longest debates surrounding the security and reliability of Proof of Stake, to a screeching halt.\nIn this article I\u2019ll do my best to address this subject with both the technical and non-technical readers in mind and explain things as simply and accurately as possible.\nTwo Proof of Stake Problems\nProof of Stake (PoS), unlike PoW, does not require computational power to generate blocks or reward the participants in the consensus. Rather, based on a \u201cStaking Algorithm\u201d developed by the blockchain developers, stakers simply run the staking wallet for the blockchain and have that blockchain\u2019s cryptocurrency in the wallet as their staking balance.\nThe staking software then generates one single \u201cvote\u201d per block, which is essentially a prediction of the next b",
