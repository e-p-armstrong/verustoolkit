    "Why is Verus using smart contracts like Ethereum and other VM-centric networks?",
    "Verus does not use smart contracts like Ethereum and other VM-centric networks. Instead, it uses smart transactions, which are much easier to use and do not require programming. This approach solves many issues with gas fees, scalability, security, and more.",

The global event for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovations this year. Here, tens of thousands of cryptocurrency enthusiasts gather to explore the newest advancements in the industry.The L0/1 Verus Protocol Solves Major Issues with Ethereum and Other VM-centric Networks\nDeveloping dApps with Verus is much more straightforward than building to a VM-based application model and results in inherently more capable, secure and scalable solutions. The Verus Protocol solves issues with gas fees, enables unlimited scale, is not vulnerable to smart contract hacks and bugs, addresses MEV at the protocol level, provides an identity model (VerusID) that applications can leverage and profit from, includes provable cross-chain and multichain support, does away with insecure and phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms, and does not require expensive Solidity developers for applications, unless they must also have an Ethereum component to them.\nAll these issues are solved with the L0/1 Verus Protocol. Verus does not use smart contracts \u2014 it uses smart transactions. Verus smart transactions [read more] are much easier to use (no programming needed) in practice to achieve most capabilities, if not all, compared to VM-protocols that use smart contracts. Yet Verus is still fully interoperable with Ethereum through the non-custodial, trustless and decentralized Verus-Ethereum Bridge with liquidity pool currency [more on the Bridge].\nShowcasing Verus Ap",
