    "What's the point of creating a VerusID profile if you can be deplatformed?",
    "That's not correct. One of the benefits of creating a VerusID profile is that you can't be deplatformed. You have total control over your profile, and it's decentralized, so you don't have to worry about someone else controlling your content or shutting you down.",
