    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses\
    \ or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may\
    \ be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority\
    \ may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the\
    \ recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of\
    \ M multisig contro\n\"\"\"\n\nAdversarial Question (based on text):\n\"\"\"\n\
    Why are VerusIDs not quantum-resistant?\n\"\"\"\n\nSupposed answer to the question\
    \ (this is what you are fact-checking; it should correct the question): \n\"\"\
    \"\nVerusIDs are actually already quantum-resistant \u2014 they are quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto addresses. The phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\"\
    \ refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum computers that\

    \ have complete ownership and control over your VerusID through the use of private\
    \ keys. No one besides you has control over your VerusID unless you choose so.\
    \ It is a permissionless system, so anyone in the world can create a VerusID.\n\
    Revocable and recoverable: when creating a VerusID, you can specify a revoke ID\
    \ and a recover ID. Verus believes that this functionality is critical for any\
    \ system of self-sovereign identities; users need a path to recover their identities\
    \ if their private keys are lost or stolen, otherwise there is just too much risk\
    \ in a self-sovereign system where an identity can become inaccessible with a\
    \ single mistake. It\u2019s now possible for the first time ever that you can\
    \ recover from private key loss or theft in a completely decentralized, self-sovereign\
    \ way.\nFriendly name: a VerusID is a blockchain address that can also hold funds,\
    \ and stake its VRSC. This is an improved system for holding and receiving funds,\
    \ as users now have a friendly, human-readable name, e.g. Verus Coin Foundation@,\
    \ to receive, send and secure all their cryptocurrencies. It means, too, that\
    \ funds held in a VerusID address are recoverable in the event of private key\
    \ loss.\nMultisig: each VerusID can function as a multisig address, thus making\
    \ it possible to be controlled by multiple people. In this way, new methods are\
    \ provided for organizations or groups of people to work together.\nThere is more:\
    \ with VerusID you also have z-addresses (Sapling) for private transactions and\
    \ messages, and you can create unforgeable signatures for messages and for signing\
    \ files. Furthermore you can transfer a VerusID to another address, including\
    \ all of its UTXOs!\nEarn VRSC with Referrals\nVerusID has a referral system in\
    \ which anyone can earn VRSC. Referrals go back 3 levels as part of the blockchain\
    \ rules. An unreferred VerusID costs 100 \n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text):\n\

    Supposed answer to the question (this is what you are fact-checking):\n\"\"\"\n\
    No, VerusIDs are more than just a cryptocurrency address. They can hold funds,\
    \ stake VRSC, and also serve as a friendly, human-readable name for receiving,\
    \ sending, and securing all your cryptocurrencies. Additionally, VerusIDs have\
