    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses\
    \ or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may\
    \ be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority\
    \ may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the\
    \ recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of\
    \ M multisig contro\n\"\"\"\n\nAdversarial Question (based on text):\n\"\"\"\n\
    Why are VerusIDs not quantum-resistant?\n\"\"\"\n\nSupposed answer to the question\
    \ (this is what you are fact-checking; it should correct the question): \n\"\"\
    \"\nVerusIDs are actually already quantum-resistant \u2014 they are quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto addresses. The phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\"\
    \ refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum computers that\
    \ use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure signature scheme\
    \ for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have all the funds\
    \ sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant.\n\nSo with regard to your\
    \ question, it seems there's some confusion, as VerusIDs are, in fact, quantum-resistant.\n\

    Content:How Verus Tames the Wild Private Key\nVerus ($VRSC) is an innovative,\
    \ fast moving cryptocurrency project that has already completed an enormous amount\
    \ of work and has some truly mind-blowing stuff live on mainnet and in development\
    \ right now. What this article covers is only one of many new use cases. If you\
    \ follow crypto and blockchain tech at all, you owe it yourself to dig deeper.\n\
    Most of the features discussed in this article are already on mainnet \u2014 which\
    \ means they\u2019re available for anyone to use. \u201CLocking\u201D and \u201C\
    unlocking\u201D are on testnet and will roll out to mainnet in the not too distant\
    \ future.In pursuit of a better internet, Verus is making important changes to\
    \ some cryptocurrency basics, improving on assumptions that have powered cryptocurrencies\
    \ since Bitcoin launched in 2011. One ground-shaking example: with Verus, even\
    \ if you lose private keys your money can still be protected.\nKeys and Addresses\n\
    First, a note about public and private keys and cryptocurrency addresses. (You\
    \ can skip this section if you\u2019re already familiar with them.)\nMost cryptocurrencies\
    \ use a pairing of public and private keys to create their addresses. You use\
    \ a string of numbers and letters derived from a public key to deposit funds.\
    \ Though it\u2019s good practice to keep a public key secret, it doesn\u2019t\
    \ have to be kept secret because it can\u2019t be used for withdrawals.\n\xB7\
    \ An example Bitcoin address:\n1BvBMSEYstWetqTFn5Au4m4GFg7xJaNVN2\n\xB7 An example\
    \ Ethereum address:\n 0x89205A3A3b2A69De6Dbf7f01ED13B2108B2c43e7\nPrivate keys,\
    \ on the other hand, have the power to spend. After you send currency an address,\
    \ it can be withdrawn by anyone who knows a corresponding private key. Private\
    \ keys have to be kept secret.\nAn imperfect analogy for a private key is the\
    \ passw\n\"\"\"\n\nQuestion (based on text):\n\"\"\"\nCan anyone withdraw funds\
    \ from a Verus address if they know the public key?\n\"\"\"\n\nSupposed answer\
    \ to the question (this is what you are fact-checking):\n\"\"\"\nNo, knowing the\
    \ public key is not enough to withdraw funds from a Verus address. Only the corresponding\
    \ private key can be used to spend or withdraw funds from an address. The public\
    \ key is used to receive funds, but it cannot be used to withdraw them.\n\"\"\""
