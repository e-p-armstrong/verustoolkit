    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses\
    \ or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may\
    \ be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority\
    \ may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the\
    \ recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of\
    \ M multisig contro\n\"\"\"\n\nAdversarial Question (based on text):\n\"\"\"\n\

    \"\nVerusIDs are actually already quantum-resistant \u2014 they are quantum-ready\

    On May 21st, 2018, one lucky miner in the world somewhere mined the first VerusCoin
    to ever exist. Since then a vastly growing number of people have discovered the
    Verus Project. They are forming a lively and thriving community that has been
    participating in the network through mining and staking the coin, and are also
    contributing to its growth.

    Verus has come a long way since more than two years ago. We are proud to share
    our achievements with you. In this article, you will reach a better understanding
    of some of the technology that has been built and what makes Verus unique and,
    in our opinion, superior:

    Fair Launch: No ICO, pre-mine or founder and developer fees.

    VerusHash 2.2: The hashing algorithm that was developed to lower mining barriers
    for everyone and create a naturally decentralized network.

    Verus Proof of Power (VerusPoP): 50% PoS, 50% PoW, a provable hybrid solution
    to 51% hash attacks.

    VerusID: Arguably the most advanced self-sovereign, decentralized identities;
    they are revocable and recoverable identities on the blockchain, packed with features
    and capabilities for everyone to use.

    Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS): Launch your own blockchain with customizable
    specifications, while using Verus infrastructure for security and continuity.
    PBaaS provides a roadmap for practically unlimited scalability.

    Multi-Reserve Currencies: Just one part of the Verus token/currency functionality,
    multi-reserve currencies are the foundation for a user-centric DeFi.

    Value for Miners & Stakers: Verus architecture provides rewards to miners and
    stakers, an entire economy that leads to a robust, strong and permanent infrastructure.
