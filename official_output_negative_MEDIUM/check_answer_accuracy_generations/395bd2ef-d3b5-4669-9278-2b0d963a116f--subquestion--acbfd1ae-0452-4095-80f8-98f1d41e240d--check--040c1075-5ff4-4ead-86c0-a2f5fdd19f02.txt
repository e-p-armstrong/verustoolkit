    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses\
    \ or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may\
    \ be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority\
    \ may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the\
    \ recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of\
    \ M multisig contro\n\"\"\"\n\nAdversarial Question (based on text):\n\"\"\"\n\

    \"\nVerusIDs are actually already quantum-resistant \u2014 they are quantum-ready\

    rowing, actual chain with both proof of work and proof of stake with an eventual
    winner. NC still has the miners and stakers create and earn from earned notarizations,
    but it also must have agreement from specified notaries to finalize any notarization
    and cannot finalize cross-chain proof roots without that agreement.

    Improvement over common cross-chain protocols

    Since Verus VIP does not ever have any identity, multisig or otherwise, hold custody
    over any funds when crossing from one decentralized network to another, even in
    the context of the Verus Ethereum contracts, threats caused by malicious notaries
    or stolen keys to drain funds on decentralized bridges or currencies are simply
    not viable against the Verus VIP protocol.

    Cross-chain notarizations must first be entered by an earning validator, either
    PoW or PoS, and must also be agreed to by another validator, alternating between
    work and stake in eligibility. Only after that happens can notary witnesses apply
    their signature and agree to make that a confirmed notarization candidate. Still,
    what happens if a majority of notaries are malicious and colluding, or if some
    entity was able to somehow steal a majority of the notary private keys?

    If the majority of notary witnesses are honest and operate their witnessing nodes
    according to the protocol, the security of such a model should be sufficient for
    any level of cross-chain transaction proof. If, however, a majority of the notaries
    were colluding and malicious or if their keys were stolen, Verus VIP still provides
    ways to ensure that the protocol responds to such a situation without risk of
    loss. Although there are ways to mitigate such a form of attack, even if no mitigation
    were available, such malicious or fraudulent notary witnesses would need the following
    in order to attack a PBaaS cross-chain connection:

    The question is flawed because it implies that Verus VIP''s security relies on
    a majority of notaries being honest. In reality, Verus VIP''s protocol is designed
    to be secure even if a majority of notaries are malicious or colluding. The protocol
