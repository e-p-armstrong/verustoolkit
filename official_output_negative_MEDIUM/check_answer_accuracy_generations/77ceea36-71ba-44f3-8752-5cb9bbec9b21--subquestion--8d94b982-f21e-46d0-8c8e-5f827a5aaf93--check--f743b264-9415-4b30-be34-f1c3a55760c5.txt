    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses\
    \ or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may\
    \ be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority\
    \ may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the\
    \ recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of\
    \ M multisig contro\n\"\"\"\n\nAdversarial Question (based on text):\n\"\"\"\n\

    \ (this is what you are fact-checking; it should correct the question): \n\"\"\
    \"\nVerusIDs are actually already quantum-resistant \u2014 they are quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto addresses. The phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\"\

    \ https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-beginners-staking-guide-efbbdc4de951\nContent:Verus\
    \ Beginner\u2019s Staking GuideThe Basics\nVerus is among the easiest cryptocurrencies\
    \ to stake and earn rewards. Unlike many staking systems your Verus is completely\
    \ accessible while it\u2019s staking, it isn\u2019t locked up, inaccessible, or\
    \ out of your control in any way. You just have to flip a switch in your wallet\
    \ to turn it on, and your Verus remains in your wallet the whole time, and can\
    \ be spent at any time.\nVerus uses a novel consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Power\
    \ (PoP) which is a hybrid half Proof-of-Work (PoW), half Proof-of-Stake (PoS)\
    \ system. Half of the blocks are mined using VerusHash, and the other half are\
    \ \u201Cminted\u201D via staking. This means that both miners and stakers are\
    \ doing the work to process transactions and secure the network, and that attackers\
    \ would need BOTH a significant share of mining hash rate AND of the available\
    \ supply of Verus (VRSC) to attack the network.\nEvery block has a chance of being\
    \ won by staking, and over time it averages out that half of the blocks are solved\
    \ by mining and half by staking. The average block time on Verus is 1 minute.\
    \ If you stake a block you\u2019ll get the block reward and any transaction fees\
    \ paid by users to have their transactions processed. At the time of writing,\
    \ the block reward is 12 VRSC, and there is a halving (the reward drops in half)\
    \ approximately every two years, the last of which was in November 2020.\nThe\
    \ chances of staking and receiving a block reward for any given block are proportional\
    \ to the amount of Verus you\u2019re staking. There is no minimum amount of Verus\
    \ required to stake, and any funds kept in a transparent address or a VerusID\
    \ that have been there for at least 150 blocks (about 150 minutes) may be used\
    \ to stake.\nYour wallet must be running, connected to the internet, \n\"\"\"\n\
    \nQuestion (based on text):\n\"\"\"\nHow do I lock up my Verus coins to start\
    \ staking and earning rewards?\n\"\"\"\n\nSupposed answer to the question (this\
    \ is what you are fact-checking):\n\"\"\"\nYou don't need to lock up your Verus\
    \ coins to start staking. In fact, one of the unique features of Verus staking\
    \ is that your coins remain completely accessible and under your control at all\
    \ times. You can spend your Verus coins at any time, even when they're being used\
    \ for staking. To start staking, you simply need to flip a switch in your wallet\
    \ to turn it on.\n\"\"\""
