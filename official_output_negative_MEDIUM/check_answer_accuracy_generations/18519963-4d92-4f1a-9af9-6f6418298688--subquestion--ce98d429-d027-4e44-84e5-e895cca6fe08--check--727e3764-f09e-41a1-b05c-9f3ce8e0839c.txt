    \ protocol, not just an ID system. There is no corporation involved in the protocol,\
    \ unlike most blockchain ID implementations. **VerusIDs** provide plenty of opportunity\
    \ for identity applications. Specifically, **VerusID** provides:\n\n### Quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses on the worldwide Verus network\nVerusIDs can be used\
    \ to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses\
    \ specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single\
    \ or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of\
    \ the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated\
    \ spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does\
    \ not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves\
    \ resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started\
    \ to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate\
    \ on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change\
    \ an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant.\
    \ Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other\
    \ blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover,\
    \ inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.\n\n### Fully Decentralized Protocol\nAnyone\
    \ can create one and have complete, self sovereign control over it without permission\
    \ to do so. All costs to create an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers.\
    \ Verus IDs are:\n\n* Revocable -- each ID includes a revocation authority, which\
    \ defaults to the identity self. If another ID is specified as the revocation\
    \ authority it can be used to revoke the identity, which creates a valid transaction\
    \ that, once mined into a block, prevents the identity from being used to spend\
    \ or sign until it is recovered, effectively freezing all of its funds, for example,\
    \ in the case of key theft or turnover in an organization.\n\n* Recoverable --\
    \ each ID also includes a separate recovery authority, which also defaults to\
    \ self. If another ID is specified as the recovery authority it can be used to\
    \ recover the ID from its revoked state, with the option to alter the primary\
    \ authorities used to spend and sign.\n\n* Private - Each ID contains a set of\
    \ zero-knowledge private addresses, which can be used as messaging, financial,\
    \ or voting endpoints, and each ID also contains a content map of key-value hashes,\
    \ intended to be used alongside applications and various identity policies to\
    \ provide everything from private yet selectively provable claims and attestations\
    \ to selectively provable components of a strong identity, attested to with a\
    \ quantum secure signature when that is available.\n\n* Powerful - Multiple addresses\
    \ or other IDs can be defined as primary addresses, and any number of those may\
    \ be required to spend, sign, or alter the identity (N of M). The revocation authority\
    \ may only be altered by the revocation authority, and the same applies to the\
    \ recovery authority, either of which may be another identity with its own N of\
    \ M multisig contro\n\"\"\"\n\nAdversarial Question (based on text):\n\"\"\"\n\
    Why are VerusIDs not quantum-resistant?\n\"\"\"\n\nSupposed answer to the question\
    \ (this is what you are fact-checking; it should correct the question): \n\"\"\
    \"\nVerusIDs are actually already quantum-resistant \u2014 they are quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto addresses. The phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses\"\
    \ refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by quantum computers that\
    \ use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure signature scheme\
    \ for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have all the funds\
    \ sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant.\n\nSo with regard to your\
    \ question, it seems there's some confusion, as VerusIDs are, in fact, quantum-resistant.\n\

    \ Accuracy and Common Knowledge Check:**\n\n  * The text describes VerusIDs as\

    \ ID to destination mappings on other blockchains.\n  * The question asserts that\
    \ VerusIDs are not quantum-resistant, which is flawed.\n\n### Final Judgment:\n\
    #### Comprehensive Assessment: The answer's claims that are related to the text\

    Content:What Verus Did (and What It\u2019s Doing)\nVerus ($VRSC) is an innovative,\
    \ fast moving cryptocurrency project that has already completed an enormous amount\
    \ of work and has some truly mind-blowing stuff on testnet and in development\
    \ right now. This article will focus on what\u2019s already on mainnet, but if\
    \ you follow crypto and blockchain tech at all, you owe it yourself to dig deeper.Recently,\
    \ in response to a post on a Verus Discord channel, someone asked what useful\
    \ tech Verus already has on mainnet. Here\u2019s a partial answer. There are at\
    \ least three big, distinct user groups for whom cryptocurrency tech might be\
    \ useful:\n1. Miners\n2. Early adopters\n3. \u201CGrandparent\u201D users \u2014\
    \ late adopters\nWe\u2019re going to talk a little about each group. These are\
    \ all observations and opinions, and some of the reasons that I think this project\
    \ is really outstanding \u2014 unique, and truly significant. After this, you\
    \ should read a little more and come to your own conclusions!\nOne of the compelling\
    \ things about Verus is how it addresses concerns at each level of the current\
    \ blockchain stack. At the base level, cryptocurrencies rely on the health of\
    \ their mining networks, so beginning a project by ensuring that the most miners\
    \ possible have an incentive to participate and can trust the project\u2019s integrity\
    \ and security is essential. Among its first innovations, Verus added options\
    \ for how projects manage their coin emissions schedule by developing coin locking\
    \ technology that incentivized early adopters while simultaneously locking out\
    \ the risk of them dumping coins early. This move proved to be characteristic\
    \ of the project, which has had its long-term development firmly in mind from\
    \ the very beginning.\nVerus also rolled out VerusHash early, making the project\

    \ user groups: miners, early adopters, and \"grandparent\" users (late adopters).\
