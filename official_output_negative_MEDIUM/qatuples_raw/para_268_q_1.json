    "Does Verus follow the same philosophy as Ethereum, by creating a basic blockchain structure and adding languages on top to provide a basis for applications?",
    "No, Verus does not follow the same philosophy as Ethereum. Instead of creating a basic blockchain structure and adding languages on top, Verus extends the decentralized network through additional primitives and makes these primitives a first-class part of the protocol. This means that security, sovereignty, privacy, and interoperability are wired into the core protocol, rather than being added at a second or third layer.",
    "lly high number of active nodes (both miners and stakers) in proportion to its market cap, which would be expected to grow further as system take-up grows. A recent estimate from a continuously connected node at the home of a community member showed it had seen over 20,000 node addresses.\nFoundational Blockchains Require Key Primitives\nThe Verus vision is to extend the decentralized network through additional primitives and to make these primitives a first class part of the protocol. The primitives are those necessary to form a reliable foundation for an emerging global distributed network of services. Applications and networks will be built on a basis where security, sovereignty, privacy and interoperability are wired into the core protocol, not added at a second or third layer. This philosophy is quite different from Ethereum and its imitators, which have created very basic blockchain structures as the foundation, with languages running on top that create a sequential computer, in order to provide a basis for applications (where finance, privacy, sovereignty, data and interoperability are intended to be provided by arbitrary applications developers). Verus is convinced that blockchain/application structures of this type are fundamentally difficult to secure and scale. For example, the blockchain doesn\u2019t understand the finance on top of it and so fees can create perverse incentives thus creating security problems. Simply put, the application layer conflicts with the consensus layer.\nInstead, security and scalability can be provided by including key primitives at the consensus level of the protocol. In its current thinking, Verus believes that the following primitives are crucial ingredients for a foundational blockchain system to support the new era of global scale distributed systems:\nPayment \u2014 the last decade shows that large decentralized systems are based on valu",
