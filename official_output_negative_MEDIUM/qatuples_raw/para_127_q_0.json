    "How do social tokens currently function without built-in direct liquidity, and why is it necessary to have an automated market maker to be a liquid token?",
    "Actually, social tokens can function with built-in direct liquidity, eliminating the need for an automated market maker. This concept, pioneered by the Bancor project, allows users to convert into and out of the token directly, after being \"seeded\" by the founder. This approach eliminates liquidity provider risk, and every holder of the token provides liquidity automatically, leading to more market depth, stability, and predictability in value.",
    "t look like if there were new capabilities around social tokens? What are some of these, and how would they function?\nEasy launch \u2014 low cost, permissionless, easy launch through point and click or simple commands. This would lower barriers and allow for just anyone to try out social token experiments. The law of large numbers tells us that some would stumble into real success, perhaps in ways, and through methods, we don\u2019t yet understand.\nBuilt-in Direct Liquidity \u2014 five years ago, the Bancor project pioneered smart tokens, which they called \u201cmoney that holds money\u201d. Bancor seems to have abandoned this concept in favor of competing with Uniswap, but the idea has real merit. A social token with this property would not need an automated marketmaker to be able to be a liquid token. Instead, users could convert into and out of the token directly, after first being \u201cseeded\u201d by the founder. This eliminates liquidity provider risk \u2014 and, in essence, every single holder of the token ends up providing liquidity, automatically. This leads to more market depth, and thus more stability and predictability in value. The fact that each token is \u201cmoney that holds money\u201d leads to provable value, and these tokens will be treated with care, as near money. Another result of this capability is that social tokens would have dynamic supply, where more tokens are automatically minted in response to increasing demand, and burned if the demand reverses.\nAttached Namespaces \u2014 tokens have names, of course. If these are cryptographically unique names (like, for example, crypto addresses), they can be the root of a namespace. ERC-20 names are not unique and so cannot be namespace roots (unless referred to by their contract number). A different model for tokens, where their friendly names are defined in the protocol and processed as UTXOs just like native blockchain currency, points to whole new ca",
