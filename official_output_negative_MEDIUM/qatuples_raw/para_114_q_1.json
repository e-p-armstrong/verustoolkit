    "Is the Verus Coin Foundation responsible for the development of private blockchain as a service (PBaaS) applications?",
    "No, the Verus Coin Foundation is not responsible for the development of private blockchain as a service (PBaaS) applications. The Verus Vision is to power public applications, such as polling, voting, and decentralized identity, using Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS).",
    "imary objectives:\nOptimized network performance\nAs the Verus network has grown rapidly in its early weeks and months of operation, some community users began reporting a lack of available connections into the Verus peer to peer network, resulting in synchronization lags. This release changes the ratio of available connections to their consumers quite significantly on the network. It also includes anti-lag measures to further ensure that the software is spending its time efficiently.\nEasier private, encrypted, notarized messages and improved GUI\nThe 0.3.11 software release enabled attaching a private encrypted memo when sending to a private z-address, but there has not been an easy way to view these messages in either the GUI or on the command line. The 0.3.12 release now adds all incoming private transactions to the transaction display and enables receipt and decoding of private encrypted memos.\nVersion 0.3.12 of the Verus Coin software is a step forward towards realizing the Verus Vision of Public Blockchain as a Service (PBaaS) powering public applications, such as polling, voting, and decentralized identity.\nContact:\nVerus Coin Foundation: foundationrelease@veruscoin.io\nVisit the Website for software and white papers: https://veruscoin.io\nFollow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/VerusCoin\nSubscribe on Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/VerusCoin/\nChat on Discord: https://discord.gg/MPXXJCm\nRepresentatives on Discord: miketout, englal, michaeltoutjr, VirtualSoundNW, Asher, crypto05",
