    "Did Satoshi Nakamoto think that electronic currency would be widely adopted by governments and institutions within 10 years?",
    "There is no indication in the text that Satoshi Nakamoto predicted widespread adoption of electronic currency by governments and institutions within 10 years.

    "Title: Satoshi\u2019s 10 Year Prophecy and Verus Coin\u2019s Vision to Help Realize It\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/satoshis-10-year-prophecy-and-verus-coin-s-vision-to-help-realize-it-8472439d132\nContent:Satoshi\u2019s 10 Year Prophecy and Verus Coin\u2019s Vision to Help Realize It\nFrom the desk of Satoshi Nakamoto, the following email on Jan 16 2009 at 18:35 UTC, made a 10 year prediction-turned-prophecy\nOn January 16, 2009 at 18:35 UTC, Satoshi in replying to Dustin Trammell, made some insightful and self-fulfilling prophecies\u2026specifically for \u201c10 years from now\u201d\u2026which falls on today, Jan 16 2019.You can read the original email on sourceforge here, but I\u2019ve copied it in it\u2019s entirety below.\nRe: [bitcoin-list] Bitcoin v0.1 released\n2009\u201301\u201316 18:35:32 UTC\nI would be surprised if 10 years from now we\u2019re not using electronic currency in some way, now that we know a way to do it that won\u2019t inevitably get dumbed down when the trusted third party gets cold feet.\nIt could get started in a narrow niche like reward points, donation tokens, currency for a game or micropayments for adult sites. Initially it can be used in proof-of-work applications for services that could almost be free but not quite.\nIt can already be used for pay-to-send e-mail. The send dialog is resizeable and you can enter as long of a message as you like. It\u2019s sent directly when it connects. The recipient doubleclicks on the transaction to see the full message. If someone famous is getting more e-mail than they can read, but would still like to have a way for fans to contact them, they could set up Bitcoin and give out the IP address on their website. \u201cSend X bitcoins to my priority hotline at this IP and I\u2019ll read the message personally.\u201d\nSubscription sites that need some extra proof-of-work for their free trial so it doesn\u2019t cannibalize subscriptions could charge bitcoins for the trial.\nIt might make sense ",
