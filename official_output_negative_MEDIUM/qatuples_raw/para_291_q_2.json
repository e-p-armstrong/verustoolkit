    "Is Verus just another vaporware project that only cares about making a profit?",
    "No, Verus is not just another vaporware project. According to the text, Verus is a project that is \"actually building real solutions and tools for a future economy and for decentralized blockchain applications\". This suggests that Verus is a project that is focused on creating real value and solving real problems, rather than just making a profit.",
    "to expand and deepen.\nIt\u2019s About Community\nI\u2019m excited to be contributing on the regular now-a-days and doing my part for the community to help shine more light on the incredible project which Verus is, to help guide others who, like me, are feeling a little lost in the sea and looking for solid land again. On that note, I want to invite anyone who is looking for meaning in cryptocurrency and blockchain to join the Verus community!\nWhile much of crypto is about buying coins to try and strike it rich, vapor ware projects selfishly pursuing their own profit or greed through well-written pitches, Verus is something rare. A project that is totally decentralized, community based, and actually building real solutions and tools for a future economy and for decentralized blockchain applications\u2026which is already proven in its development base and is established in solving the biggest problems (real and theoretical) in blockchain\u2026it\u2019s as rare as was bitcoin when it first took showed up.\nSure, you can buy Verus Coin and stake it, earning rewards for helping to secure the blockchain via Proof of Stake...or even mine VRSC with modern CPUs, helping in the decentralization and security of the Proof of Work side of consensus. But honestly the best way you can get Verus Coin is by joining the community and helping out, becoming a part of the \u201chuman network\u201d of decentralized contributors and members who are making Verus the thriving project, community and ecosystem it is fast becoming.\nIf you would like to learn more about Verus Coin and get involved in any way, whether in mining and helping secure the blockchain or through contributing and joining the community (or both!), visit the official site at https://veruscoin.io and join the official Verus Discord.",
