    "How does Verus's \"global computer\" architecture enable secure and permissionless interactions between different blockchain systems?",
    "Verus does not have a \"global computer\" architecture. In fact, the text explicitly states that such an approach presents scaling challenges and security risks, as value and fees can drift to the application layer and become unrecognizable at the protocol level. Instead, Verus's design philosophy is based on the idea that different blockchain systems can interact with each other through data, without the need for a single, universal programming language or architecture.",
    "te with another in a way that\u2019s reliable and makes sense, using the concepts of \u201cstate root\u201d (a one number root that covers the whole blockchain) and notarization signatures which give the ability to prove transactions that exist on another chain. By enabling full scale interoperability at the protocol level the Verus system does not need a turing complete programmable layer, as required actions can occur on other systems where required provided that systems are exchanging data in a way that they can all understand\nIntegrated Blockchain Creation \u2014the path to virtually unlimited scalability lies in the ability to provision additional interoperable blockchains at will, without the necessity to provision additional resources (hardware, wallets, etc.). Verus enables this through its PBaaS system where any blockchain can be used to provision a new blockchain that is immediately interoperable to every other Verus blockchain (and thereby to the greater blockchain universe) and has immediate access to the installed base of Verus\u2019 miners, stakers, wallets, apps, etc. These new blockchains inherit Verus\u2019 security through a system of notarization into the main Verus blockchain.\nThe effect of the design philosophy is to allow functionality that securely and permissionlessly goes across systems, whether from one Verus blockchain to another, or to other blockchain systems such as Ethereum. Functionality can be triggered from one system to another. The fundamental idea is that in the real world we have multitudes of environments and languages, and things connect through data. There is no requirement for a \u201cglobal computer\u201d that runs applications using a single language \u2014 in fact, that method presents clear scaling challenges, and is insecure as value and fees drift to the application layer and are unrecognizable at the protocol level. Instead Verus lays out the fundamental primitive",
