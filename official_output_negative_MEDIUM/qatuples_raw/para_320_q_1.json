    "Why can't IDs and currencies be used across multiple chains, since they are tied to a specific chain?",
    "IDs and currencies can be used across multiple chains. They can be created and launched on one chain, leveraging all of that chain's capabilities, and exported to other chains to be used everywhere across the network. This is possible because all identities and currencies are resolvable worldwide, meaning that you can determine a network path to the nodes of the blockchain where they were defined via their friendly name or i-address.",
    "T-like tokens that have a super power over the ID, which is very useful for an ID that may live across multiple chains.\nIDs and currencies may be created and launched on one chain, leveraging all of that chains capabilities (Verus includes many variations in currency, including conditional crowdfunding, liquidity pools, blockchains, etc.), and exported to other chains to be used everywhere across the network. For example, if you launch a currency on Verus or any PBaaS chain, including the native PBaaS chain\u2019s currency. All of those currency definitions can be exported to Ethereum, and they will emerge on Ethereum as an automatically created and functional ERC20 contract, enabling the currency to be sent back and forth via protocol from then on.\nAll identities and currencies are resolvable worldwide, meaning that you can determine a network path to the nodes of the blockchain where they were defined via their friendly name, or usually via their i-address, if they have been exported cross-chain. This enables apps to scale over any number of decentralized blockchains worldwide and leave the management of user databases and user data, as well as settings, signals, endpoints, etc. to the users themselves and the client apps they use to help them manage.\nBecause the currency and liquidity pool support is in the L1 protocol, we have been able to actually solve for and provide MEV-resistant (both intra and inter-block) AMMs as a primitive, available to all applications and users.\nPeople don\u2019t have to write basic liquidity and conversion protocols, which are just primitives, not apps. Real apps can use all of these primitives to deliver the next level of function. Payments, currency conversions, earning systems, polls, voting, multi-chain world scale social networks using provable streams in provable IDs, crowdfunding, independent economies. All primitives, such as IDs, curren",
