    "What is the main reason why community currencies have been successful?",
    "Community currencies have not been successful, and the main reasons are the lack of essential features such as auditability, transparency, and digital wallets. Additionally, there are other key issues that need to be addressed, including the requirement for sophisticated engineering capability to implement, lack of easy and reliable convertibility into fiat currency, and no easy way to capture the Community Contributed Value.",
    "nd the tokens could be securely stored and controlled through digital wallets. Bitcoin itself is an example of a type of community contributed value, where demand to use and hold gives it its value, to the benefit of a worldwide virtual community of early adopters. Ease of creation and use has been enhanced as against paper currencies, at least for the technically adept. Still, no longstanding successful cases of broad local community use have emerged. In fact some, such as CityCoins, have been notorious failures.\nIt seems that auditability, transparency and digital wallets are not enough. Other key issues are:\ncommunity currencies still require some sophisticated engineering capability to implement\nthere is no method for easy, reliable convertibility into the prevailing fiat currency, nor can conversion rates hope to be predictable or stable, even in the short term\nthere is no easy way to safely and measurably capture the Community Contributed Value\nthere are no additional enhancements to community or the currency through attached digital goods and a new digital goods economy\nNew Solutions \u2014 Bancor; Verus, public blockchains as a service\nIt is likely that, were these problems solved, and ease of digital wallet use addressed (along with personal privacy), motivated communities would find it far easier to bootstrap use of a community currency {\u201cCommCurr\u201d}. Imagine being able to spend your CommCurr anywhere in the community, from the babysitter to the gas station to the bank, and have it accepted with ease because the recipient knows that they can convert it easily and immediately, and without a counterparty, at the push of a button, to the USD, on a 1:1 basis (or very near thereabouts). And if community members could measurably observe the amount of Community Contributed Value that was emerging through widespread and persistent use, CommCurr would be easy to promote, a",
