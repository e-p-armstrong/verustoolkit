    "All Eyes on Verus During Consensus 2022\nAs you might know, Verus attended Consensus 2022 in Austin, on June 9\u201312, with its very own booth. It was a successful conference for the community, lots of fun, lots of heads turned, and lots of interest. Many community members attended, and for most of us it was the first time we all met in real life! It was an absolute pleasure and privilege meeting fellow community members and making friends along the way. The conference ignited a renewed sense of urgency for the continuation of the Verus mission. A public good for all of humanity, enabling novel ways for people to work together and create value. The future is bright. Thanks to everyone who donated that made this a possibility!\n\ud83d\udcd6 \u27a1\ufe0f Community member tango808 wrote a summary of all that was happening.
