    "Can earned notarizations be created by anyone, including users on Ethereum?",
    "No, earned notarizations can only be created by Verus or PBaaS chain miners and stakers. They are created by adding a notarization output to the coinbase, and are subject to further confirmation rules.",
    "as front-running and sandwiching once and for all.\nAll cross-chain operations are proven based on one of the following proof models, which are configurable on a per system/chain basis:\nDecentralized consensus-achieved, witness enhanced, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (auto-notarization)\nDecentralized consensus-achieved, witness-dependent, cross-chain cryptographic proofs. (notary dependent notarization)\nSemi-centralized or centrally controlled gateway proofs\nFull auto-notarization is only available between Verus and PBaaS chains, and operates faster with but is not dependent on notary witnesses. When auto-notarization is applied to other gateway connections, the protocol will fall back to the closest it can come between auto-notarization and notary dependent, which may evolve towards less dependence on the notaries in future versions. Whether you auto-notarize or depend on notary witness confirmation, all forms of notarization operate similarly. We\u2019ll start with the basic workflow, then highlight differences:\n\u201cEarned\u201d and \u201cAccepted\u201d notarizations \u2014 VIP broadly defines two types of cross-system notarizations, earned and accepted.\nGenerally, one side of a connection will create \u201cearned\u201d notarizations, which on PBaaS chains or for the Ethereum bridge, are created by miners and stakers adding a notarization output to the coinbase. Earned notarizations, which can only be created by Verus or PBaaS chain miners and stakers, include a way to agree or disagree with specific past notarizations, and are subject to further \u201cconfirmation\u201d rules, which may vary depending on if the rules are \u201cauto\u201d, centralized, or \u201cnotary confirm\u201d.\nOnce a new, earned notarization is confirmed, the proof of confirmation is sent to the \u201cnotary\u201d system, which is typically a launch chain, and in the case of the ETH bridge, is Ethereum, along with any notary signatures necessary to prove confirmation",
