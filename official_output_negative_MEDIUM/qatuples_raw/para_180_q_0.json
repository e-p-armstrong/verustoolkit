    "How can I use Ethereum to create a blockchain with the same capabilities as Verus?",
    "You cannot currently use Ethereum to create a blockchain with the same capabilities as Verus. According to the text, these capabilities do not currently exist on Ethereum or other smart contract blockchains due to the complexity of implementing them.",
    "Conclusions\nThese are new blockchain capabilities. They do not currently exist on Ethereum or other smart contract blockchains because the interplay of such different elements would seem to create overwhelming complexity, requiring the use of multiple inter-operating contracts to implement. Certainly, such comprehensive and flexible solutions could not be carried out in minutes through the use of a few simple commands.\nCurrently, all of these capabilities exist in the Verus protocols and are in use on testnet. A mainnet activation is imminent, and communities can soon start to experiment, at the smallest initial scales they desire. It\u2019s important to note, however, that additional software development would be required to make some of these elements easy and safe to use for the broader community. As a FOSS project, Verus encourages communities to work together, and with the Verus developer community to create open source apps that leverage the protocols, so that all communities worldwide can benefit from the resulting development.\nDiscuss and explore all Verus has to offer on Discord\nFollow on Twitter\nGo to verus.io",
