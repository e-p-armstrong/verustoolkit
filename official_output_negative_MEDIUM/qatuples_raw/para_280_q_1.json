    "Are Verus's PBaaS-chains only able to do 75 tps, without any possibility of increasing the transaction speed?",
    "No, that's not correct. According to the text, a single PBaaS-chain can do between 75 and 800 tps, depending on the options chosen. This indicates that the transaction speed can be increased by adjusting the configuration of the PBaaS-chain.",
    "ganization\u2019s need, inherit all the same features as the Verus blockchain, and most importantly are fully interconnected and interoperable with the complete network and other bridged protocols (e.g. Ethereum). A single PBaaS-chain can do between 75 and 800 tps depending on the options chosen.\nThere is no upper limit to deploying PBaaS-chains. Just like there is no upper limit to servers being deployed. When we reach a bandwidth limit we don\u2019t go out upgrading our single server, we put another server next to it to spread out the usage. The same thing is here, reaching unlimited scalability.\nOf course, this only works when those PBaaS-chains are fully interoperable and interconnected, which they are \u2014 in a provable, trustless and decentralized way. There is no centralized entity sitting in between the PBaaS-chains regulating everything.\nCross-chain transactions and conversions, cross-chain bridging of identities (VerusID), tokens and basket currencies, even Ethereum (& ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155) \u2014 it\u2019s all built into the consensus mechanism, trustlessly bridged over by the decentralized network of miners and stakers only. This is all on mainnet now, for everyone to use.\nWe can conclude that Verus is scalable to billions of people around the world with the unlimited deployment of PBaaS-chains. But does it compromise on decentralization and thus security? Let\u2019s dive into it.\nVerus lead developer Mike Toutonghi explains how unlimited scalability is achieved.\nBuilt to be Decentralized\nThere are a few things at play here that work in harmony to achieve decentralization and security \u2014 Verus Proof of Power (the hybrid 50% proof-of-work, 50% proof-of-stake consensus mechanism), merge-mining and the Fee Pool.\nVerus had no ICO, had no premine and had and has no developer fee or tax.\nBefore we jump into the above let\u2019s acknowledge some facts that are pivotal to being a true decentralize",
