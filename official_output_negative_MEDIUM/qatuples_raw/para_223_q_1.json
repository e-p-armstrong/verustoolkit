    "To launch a currency on Verus, do you need to fund the VerusID with a large amount of a specific cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin?",
    "No, to launch a currency on Verus, you need to fund VGG@ with 200+ VRSCTEST, which is a native cryptocurrency of the Verus blockchain, not Bitcoin.",
    "epending on which blockchain you want to define a currency on. When launching PBaaS-chains you can define your own costs in the chains\u2019 native currency. Good to know: these costs are going to the miners and stakers of the blockchain.\nWith a few simple commands, we will:\nDefine the currency\nHave it signed by a second signature\nLaunch the currency\nBefore starting we must fund VGG@ with 200+ VRSCTEST to launch the currency. The chain definition is as follows:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST definecurrency '{\n \"name\":\"VGG\", \n \"options\":32, \n \"proofprotocol\":2\n}'\nIt\u2019s a simple chain definition, with only \u201coptions\u201d:32 (= the currency is just a token), and \u201cproofprotocol\u201d:2 (= the controller of the VerusID where the currency is launched from can mint and burn tokens at will).\nThese are some options and specifications that are possible when launching a currency: as a simple token, as fractional reserve currency or multi-reserve basket, start & end block, min. & max. preconversions, initial contributions, pre-launch discount & carveout, initial supply and much more.\n\u2b50 To learn more about the many different launch options when defining a currency on Verus, go here \ud83d\udd17 We encourage anyone to start testing the protocol to get ahead of the game. The community is happy to help on Discord \ud83d\udd17\nApproving and launching the currency\nNow, the second signer needs to come in and sign off on the currency definition, and launch the currency.\nThe command from before gives out a HEX. The second signer needs to sign this HEX as follows:\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST signrawtransaction \"hex\"\nThis gives out another HEX. We use it to submit the transaction to the chain, which in turn launches the currency.\n./verus -chain=VRSCTEST sendrawtransaction \"hex\"\nAfter doing the command above, it takes around 15 blocks before the currency is officially launched on the network.\nNext step is the minting and burning of toke",
