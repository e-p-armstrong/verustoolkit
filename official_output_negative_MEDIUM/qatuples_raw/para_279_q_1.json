    "Does Verus believe that the internet is a single-server world?",
    "No, Verus acknowledges that the internet is a giant, interconnected multi-server world, where all applications and websites are seamlessly connected. This understanding is what led Verus to develop a multi-chain approach, rather than trying to scale a single monolithic blockchain.",
    "t back to the current situation in crypto land. Most, if not all, crypto protocols are trying to service the world with their one single, monolithic blockchain. The monolithic blockchain becomes a central hub where all smart contracts and applications revolve around. When they notice that it doesn\u2019t scale (the transaction fees start ramping up) the industry comes up with solutions that heavily compromise on decentralization and security (e.g. L2s, semi-centralized protocols, master nodes). This is not the answer.\nInstead of acknowledging that the Internet today is a giant, interconnected multi-server world where all applications and websites are seamlessly connected, most of the crypto industry thinks we live in a single server (single blockchain) world.\nVerus acknowledged that to realize the promise of cryptocurrency and blockchain, it needed to scale for billions of people around the globe and thus it needed to embrace a multi-server, multi-chain world. And that is exactly what the Verus Protocol does today. Without sacrificing decentralization and security.\nUnlimited in Scale\nBefore we start explaining how Verus is truly decentralized and secure, let\u2019s start with how Verus embraces the multi-chain world and delivers unlimited scalability.\nMost, if not all, current blockchain protocols argue that to have low transaction fees they must achieve higher transactions per second. They try to scale up \u2014 increasing the performance of their monolithic blockchains. This only gets them so far. At some point, they will bottleneck again, and in the process, they compromise on decentralization and security.\nVerus offers a new approach, one in which each organization or business can launch its own highly capable, rent-free, no-coding-required blockchain. It\u2019s called Verus PBaaS (Public Blockchains as a Service). These PBaaS-chains are fully independent, can be customized to the or",
