    "Are VerusIDs limited to representing digital assets?",
    "No, VerusIDs can represent any kind of asset, not just digital ones. They can be used to represent ownership of physical assets, subscriptions to exclusive content, or any other type of asset that can be represented on the Verus blockchain.",
    " all features as they are on the Verus blockchain.\nVerusIDs can hold funds. They can be personal profiles, corporate websites, or government portals. VerusIDs are much more than identities or today\u2019s NFTs. They are owned assets of all kinds on the Verus blockchain. And now those assets can be exchanged easily.\nWith the VerusID Marketplace protocol, anyone is able to buy and sell VerusIDs. You can look for offers on any VerusID (buy or sell offers). If you like the best offer on your VerusID, or if someone likes an offer you made on theirs, the deal is made 100% peer-to-peer, decentralized on the blockchain, without any middleman or contract controller.\nFor total payment privacy, you can even pay or receive payment using private addresses and zero knowledge transactions based on the Zcash Sapling protocol.\nExchanging in Private\nIn addition to advertising worldwide on the blockchain to buy or sell VerusIDs, you can also make an exchange with the Marketplace without ever posting the offer on the blockchain until it is agreed and signed by all parties. Combine that with zero knowledge transactions, and it\u2019s a great way to transact worldwide, escrow-free in private.\nA powerful use case example: A business sells subscriptions for exclusive content. They make VerusIDs with contracts that give access to the exclusive content. They now create a transaction that would pay for the VerusID. They give the transaction to the buyer who then executes it. The buyer now owns the VerusID that gives access to the exclusive content.\nNow imagine how you can do this for a VerusID that can be any kind of asset. A new way for everyone to engage in peer-to-peer, escrow-free commerce has arrived.\nFive New APIs\nVerusID Marketplace introduces five new RPC APIs and CLI commands for this major upgrade: makeoffer, takeoffer, getoffers, closeoffers and listopenoffers.\nmakeoffer: define what you offer",
