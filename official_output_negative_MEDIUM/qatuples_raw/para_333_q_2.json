    "Is Verus only compatible with UTXO coins?",
    "No, Verus is not only compatible with UTXO coins. Its decentralized bridging protocols will allow various coins, including both ETH-like and UTXO coins, to be represented on the Verus system in a decentralized manner. Additionally, Verus-created currencies can be sent to and represented in the Ethereum network as automatically created ERC20 tokens, expanding the universe of potential tokens and coins with liquidity across the Verus system and other leading blockchain networks.",
    " a pool. A user simply uses the definecurrency api (or a few clicks on the wallet GUI) to launch a new multi-reserve currency. It is a risk-less, permission-less process. Coupled with Verus\u2019 multi-chain capabilities and easy creation of independent blockchains, new currencies, tokens and projects can set up community liquidity, and bootstrap it to a level commensurate to their size. This opens the door to all kinds of novel uses and developments.\nUser-Centric DeFi\nThe Verus community believes that community driven liquidity does not need to be driven entirely by yield farming (and increased costs to users), but that ample liquidity will emerge under near-zero-cost conditions, and that this liquidity will provide the lowest friction, lowest cost, lowest risk, fairest conversion transactions for the crypto and wider financial communities. As discussed above, liquidity will come from investors using multi-reserves as novel investment vehicles, from system liquidity (where continuous use begets its own liquidity), and from novel probabilistic arbitrage strategies which may result in staying \u201cinvested\u201d in multi-reserves for multi-block periods. Also, coin communities, whales, and others who wish to bootstrap liquidity can do so more easily than in a VM-based system because they can do it with less risk and cost.\nWhat is Verus\u2019 DeFi Universe?\nVerus is currently in the advanced stages of implementing its decentralized bridging protocols which will allow various coins, both ETH-like and UTXO coins, and others, to be represented on the Verus system in a decentralized manner, and it will also allow all Verus-created currencies to be sent to and represented in the Ethereum network as automatically created ERC20 tokens. This will lead to an expansive universe of potential tokens and coins with liquidity across the Verus system and other leading blockchain networks.\nIn addition, w",
