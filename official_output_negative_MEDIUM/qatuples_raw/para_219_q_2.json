    "How do I update my wallet to use a new block reward size, since the block reward is not going to be halved?",
    "The block reward is actually going to be halved, not remain the same. The current block reward is 48 coins, and it will be halved in the future.",
    "n email every time a new block is mined. You can then login and shield it, unshield it, etc. If you setup the backup script, it will also email your wallet.dat file to your secure protonmail account every time a new block is mined.\nIf you want to use an existing wallet for staking, you would do all the above steps up until waiting for the system to sync. Then after it syncs, you\u2019d stop verus with ./verus-cli/verus stop and replace the wallet.dat file located in the .komodo/VRSC folder with your wallet.dat file. Then start the daemon again and you\u2019ll see your balance.\nFinal Notes\nAs I mentioned above, having UTXOs of 500 or less is ideal\u2026and really closer to 500 is better for staking. You can see all your UTXOs at any time by issuing the command: ./verus-cli/verus listunspent\nOn that note, because a block reward is 48 coins presently and soon to be halved, it can benefit you to shield several blocks before unshielding a larger sum. For example, you can shield each block as it arrives, then check your zAddr balance and say when it\u2019s near 400 coins you can unshield all in a single transaction\u2026which in turn creates a UTXO of that size which is more ideal for staking than, say, 47.999 coins.\nI hope this guide is found to be helpful and easy to follow and if you have any questions please feel free to connect with me in the Verus Discord server! If there\u2019s any issue with the above info I\u2019ll make updates as necessary.
