    "Why is it not possible to burn CommCurr supply when converting it to USD?",
    "It is actually possible to burn CommCurr supply when converting it to USD. When a user sends CommCurr for USD, some CommCurr supply will be automatically burned, and the reserves of USD will decrease. This is one of the mechanisms that helps maintain the value of CommCurr and ensures that it is backed by its reserves.",
    "o CommCurr. This would build up the locked reserves of CommCurr. Or, they could go the other way around, converting CommCurr into USDC immediately by converting it into its reserves, without any need to find a counterparty. This would reduce the locked reserves. The conversion rate in these situations is driven by Automated Market Maker (AMM) technology, similar to Uniswap, although providing a MEV-resistant fair conversion experience for all users at the lowest possible fees.\nReserve backing in the Verus protocols is user-selected upon the creation of a currency, ranging from a 5% backing to a 100% backing, Multiple currencies, with arbitrarily selected weights can be used. There is a requirement to use the Verus coin as at least one of the currencies backing CommCurr, or any currency \u2014 it needs to represent at least 5% of the backing. This is due to interoperability goals, to ensure that networks built using the Verus protocols stay connected, as a worldwide network of value, where currencies connect to each other throughout.\nThese few simple options make for a host of use cases, which will not all be explored here. Instead, we\u2019ll focus on CommCurr and note that a decent implementation might have backing consisting of two currencies \u2014 USD (represented by USDC bridged from the Ethereum network), and Verus, weighted 95:5 in favor of USD.\nAs a result of having valuable reserves, CommCurr is guaranteed to be valuable, and users can instantly convert in and out of it by simply sending it to themselves, or another person, choosing a conversion option. If a user sends USD and receives CommCurr then the reserves for USD will go up, and two things will happen to CommCurr \u2014 it will issue a little bit of new supply, and its value will go up. On the other hand, if a user goes the other way, sending CommCurr for USD, then some CommCurr supply will be automatically burned, and th",
