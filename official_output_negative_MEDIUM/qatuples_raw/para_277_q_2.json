    "Is it true that a blockchain must be less decentralized to achieve high scalability?",
    "No, it is not true that a blockchain must be less decentralized to achieve high scalability. This is a common misconception, but Verus has found a way to solve the scalability trilemma without compromising decentralization or security. A blockchain can be both decentralized and scalable, and Verus is an example of this.",
    "Title: Scalability, Decentralization & Security\u200a\u2014\u200aWhat Trilemma?\nArticle URL: https://medium.com/veruscoin/scalability-decentralization-security-what-trilemma-8d2d6869924d\nContent:Scalability, Decentralization & Security \u2014 What Trilemma?\nThe blockchain trilemma is a classic idea that truly decentralized blockchains need to choose between security or scalability. Verus offers a different perspective and a new approach. Together we will come to the conclusion that the Verus Protocol solves scalability by neither sacrificing decentralization or security, effectively solving the trilemma.A Closer Look at the Trilemma\nBefore we dive in, let\u2019s examine the current perceived definition of the crypto trilemma: \u201cYou can\u2019t have a scalable blockchain that is truly decentralized and thus secure\u201d \u2014 it is said to achieve worldwide scalability a blockchain needs to be fast so it can process all the transactions for a large population (btw, this is a false premise, you can read about that later.) And to get a fast, high tps (transactions per second) blockchain it must compromise on decentralization and thus security.\nDecentralization and security go hand-in-hand. A truly decentralized protocol (open to all, many validators) is secure because it is difficult to 51% attack such a protocol. If a blockchain is less decentralized (low number of validators, permissioned access) it could be 51% attacked (by external attackers or colluding validators), and transactions can be altered or reversed, completely undermining one of the goals of blockchain \u2014 censorship-resistance.\nThe trilemma is currently looked at from a single-chain standpoint. A false premise that does not scale to the world.\nThere is truth to the fact that it is very difficult to have a decentralized single blockchain that also has a high tps. The larger the number of validators the harder it is to find consensus among them all",
