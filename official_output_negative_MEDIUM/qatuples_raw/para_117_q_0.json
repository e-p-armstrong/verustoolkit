    "How do you create a new token currency or blockchain on the Verus platform if you don't have any programming knowledge?",
    "You can create a new token currency or even a full-fledged blockchain on the Verus platform without any programming knowledge. The Verus platform allows users to create their own token currency or blockchain without programming, making it accessible to anyone with an ID.",
    "ID protocol is a protocol, which can also be implemented on non-Verus systems.\n3. Multi-currency, user created, decentralized tokens and merge-mineable, interoperable blockchains without programming \u2014 Enables any user with an ID to create their own token currency or even full fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing 50% POW/50% POS, 51% hash attack resistant blockchain that can send and receive from the Verus chain which launched it.\nAll PBaaS chains run from the same daemon, and projects may choose to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon. In doing so, they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n4. Consensus integrated DeFi liquidity pools and fractional currency baskets \u2014 Enables any ID owner to define Verus DeFi fractional basket currencies with one or more asset currencies backing the liquidity pool at a fractional percentage ranging from 5% to 100%.\nThe Verus DeFi protocol ensures that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously, addressing the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running, while providing fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners, stakers, and liquidity providers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n5. Simultaneous blockchain and blockchain liquidity pool launches \u2014 Enables the launch of a world class, worldwide, merge-mineable blockchain along with a fully decentralized or centralized \u201cbridge\u201d converter liquidity pool as part of defining a new blockchain.\nBridge converter currencies have the same flexibility as other fractional 100% asset backed or partially asset backed c",
