    "How do miners and stakers get rewarded with a full block reward when they mine a new block on the Verus network?",
    "Miners and stakers don't get a full block reward when they mine a new block on the Verus network. In addition to the coinbase reward, they also take a small portion of the Fee Pool, which collects fees from various protocol activities such as creating a blockchain, registering VerusIDs, making conversions, and more.",
    " for finding a new block), they also take a small portion of the Fee Pool. The Fee Pool collects fees that are paid by users when they are interacting with the protocol. Protocol fees include:\nPBaaS-chain: creating a blockchain on Verus costs 10,000 VRSC. 5,000 VRSC goes into the Verus Fee Pool, and 5,000 VRSC goes into the Fee Pool of the created blockchain, earned by miners and stakers of that blockchain\n(DeFi) Currency and tokens: creating a currency on the Verus blockchain costs 200 VRSC\nVerusID: identity fees for miners and stakers are 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100 VRSC\nsubID: under launched currencies and tokens subIDs can be created, these cost 0.02 VRSC\nConversion fees: each time a user converts currencies it costs 0.025% or 0.05% \u2014 miners and stakers get 50% of these fees\nTransaction fees: each transaction is minimally 0.0001 VRSC\nMiners and stakers are protecting the blockchain and at the same time servicing the Verus economy. We expect the Fee Pool rewards to exceed the coinbase rewards.\nThink about it: someone creates a PBaaS-chain, 5,000 VRSC goes to the Fee Pool, the winner of the next block gets 50 VRSC extra on top of the coinbase reward. Now imagine a whole lot of economic activity: users making conversions through the protocol, registering VerusIDs, creating DeFi currencies and tokens, and the Fee Pool can get quite large.\nVerus Fee Pool. Percentage is subject to change before hitting mainnet.\nMerge-Mine up to 22 Chains\nThe example above is only for mining Verus directly. Keep in mind that Verus is a multichain protocol. All PBaaS-chains in the protocol have exactly the same specifications as the Verus mainchain. They too have a Fee Pool that collects fees through VerusID registrations, conversions, DeFi currency and tokens and even in a later stage also PBaaS-chains!\nAnd you can mine 22 of them! All with the same hashrate as you would when mining only Verus",
