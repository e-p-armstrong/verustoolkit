    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm interested in staking, but I don't want to download the Verus Agama wallet. Is there a way to start staking without it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm afraid not. To start staking, you'll need to download and set up the Verus Agama wallet. It's a necessary step to participate in the Verus blockchain and begin staking. You can download the portable Verus enhanced Agama for your OS from https://veruscoin.io/#download.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, I've downloaded the wallet. Now, what's the purpose of choosing \"BTC\" from the \"Native mode\" dropdown in the Verus Agama wallet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you shouldn't choose \"BTC\" from the dropdown. When opening Verus enhanced Agama, you need to choose VRSC from the \"Native mode\" drop down to proceed with setting up your wallet for staking and participating in the Verus blockchain. Choosing VRSC is the correct option to get started with Verus.",
