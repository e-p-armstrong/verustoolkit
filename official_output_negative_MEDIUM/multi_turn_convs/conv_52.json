    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been following the Verus project and I'm really excited about the potential. I was wondering, is the Verus Hardware Wallet already available for purchase?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot yet, I'm afraid. The Verus Hardware Wallet is still in the early days of development. Community member jesse is working hard on the open-source hardware wallet, but it's not ready for purchase just yet.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a bit of a bummer. On a related note, I've been trying to track some transactions on the Insight Explorer. Can I search for transactions on the Insight Explorer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou can do even more than that! On the updated Insight Explorer, you can search for VerusIDs, not just transactions. Plus, it also shows special transactions, such as VerusID creations. So, you've got more options than just searching for transactions.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really cool. I've also been waiting for the Ethereum Bridge and new website release. Is that already live?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, no. The Ethereum Bridge and new website release have been delayed. Don't worry, there aren't any fundamental issues, it's just a matter of time. The team is working hard to get everything ready, but it's not live just yet.",
