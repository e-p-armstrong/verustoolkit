    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about the system. Is it true that the system doesn't guarantee a fair price for transactions, and that buyers and sellers may get different prices for the same transaction?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The system ensures that everyone gets the fair price for their transaction, and it's the same price for all buys and sells submitted by everyone within that block, with zero spread. The system is designed to provide a fair and transparent pricing mechanism, so you don't have to worry about getting a bad deal.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know. I've also heard that on-chain currency launches are only available for a select few, and require permission from a central authority. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The latest testnet release allows anyone to use the command line (with an easy-to-use dashboard in development) to freely mint their own token, pegged to any currency or asset. This means that anyone can create their own on-chain currency, without needing permission from a central authority. It's a truly decentralized system.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about fractional reserve currencies? I've heard that they don't allow for the conversion of coins into VRSC or other currencies.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's not correct. If the creators of a new coin choose to deposit an amount of VRSC in the reserve, it enables anyone holding the new coin to convert this new coin into VRSC or from VRSC into that new coin. This means that coin creators no longer have to rely on exchange listings and paying high fees to access markets and liquidity pools.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about the reserves themselves? I've heard that fractional reserve token currencies aren't required to have the native currency of the chain as part of their reserves.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's not correct. Fractional reserve token currencies do need to have the native currency of the chain as part of their reserves, and PBaaS chains that have fractional capabilities will have to contain their parent chain's native currency. This ensures that the system remains stable and secure.",
