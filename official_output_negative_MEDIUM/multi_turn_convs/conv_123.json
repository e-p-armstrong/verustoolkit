    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've heard some concerns about block producers manipulating the system for their own gain. How does Verus's Fee Pool mechanism allow block producers to \"snipe\" blocks for their own gain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception. Verus's Fee Pool mechanism is designed to prevent block producers from \"sniping\" blocks for their own gain. By spreading extra fees over many blocks, Verus mitigates the behavior of block producers trying to destabilize the protocol by sniping blocks. So, it's actually a security feature that prevents malicious activity.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been looking into smart contracts and was wondering, are smart contracts written with Solidity secure and free of bugs?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, unfortunately not. Smart contracts written with Solidity are not secure and are prone to bugs and hacks. The VM-based application model used in most blockchain protocols is insecure and has phishing-prone wallet approval mechanisms. Verus, on the other hand, follows a different approach, where security layers are located in the protocol itself, making it more secure. So, while Solidity has its uses, it's not the most secure option for smart contracts.",
