    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm really interested in learning more about how VerusIDs can be used in everyday life. How do I use VerusIDs to store and manage my social media profiles?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerusIDs are actually not limited to social media profiles. They can hold funds, be personal profiles, corporate websites, or government portals. They are owned assets of all kinds on the Verus blockchain. They can represent any kind of asset, not just identities or social media profiles. So, you can think of VerusIDs as a versatile tool that can be used in a variety of ways, not just limited to social media.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. Can I use VerusIDs to buy and sell assets on a centralized exchange?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs are exchanged on a decentralized marketplace protocol, without any middleman or contract controller. The VerusID Marketplace protocol allows anyone to buy and sell VerusIDs in a 100% peer-to-peer, decentralized manner on the blockchain. This means that you have full control over your assets and transactions, without relying on a centralized authority.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. Are VerusIDs limited to representing digital assets?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusIDs can represent any kind of asset, not just digital ones. They can be used to represent ownership of physical assets, subscriptions to exclusive content, or any other type of asset that can be represented on the Verus blockchain. This flexibility is one of the key benefits of VerusIDs, allowing you to manage and own a wide range of assets in a secure and decentralized way.",

VerusIDs are much more than identities or today\u2019s NFTs. They are owned assets of all kinds on the Verus blockchain. And now those assets can be exchanged easily.\nWith the VerusID Marketplace protocol, anyone is able to buy and sell VerusIDs. You can look for offers on any VerusID (buy or sell offers). If you like the best offer on your VerusID, or if someone likes an offer you made on theirs, the deal is made 100% peer-to-peer, decentralized on the blockchain, without any middleman or contract controller.\nFor total payment privacy, you can even pay or receive payment using private addresses and zero knowledge transactions based on the Zcash Sapling protocol.\nExchanging in Private\nIn addition to advertising worldwide on the blockchain to buy or sell VerusIDs, you can also make an exchange with the Marketplace without ever posting the offer on the blockchain until it is agreed and signed by all parties. Combine that with zero knowledge transactions, and it\u2019s a great way to transact worldwide, escrow-free in private.\nA powerful use case example: A business sells subscriptions for exclusive content. They make VerusIDs with contracts that give access to the exclusive content. They now create a transaction that would pay for the VerusID. They give the transaction to the buyer who then executes it. The buyer now owns the VerusID that gives access to the exclusive content.\nNow imagine how you can do this for a VerusID that can be any kind of asset. A new way for everyone to engage in peer-to-peer, escrow-free commerce has arrived.\nFive New APIs\nVerusID Marketplace introduces five new RPC APIs and CLI commands for this major upgrade: makeoffer, takeoffer, getoffers, closeoffers and listopenoffers.\nmakeoffer: define what you offer",
