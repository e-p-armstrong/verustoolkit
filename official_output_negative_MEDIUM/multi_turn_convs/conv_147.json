    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been curious about the history of VerusHash. What led Verus to improve the VerusHash to better equalize hardware types?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's an interesting question. Verus developers reached out to the company selling the FPGA bitstream and offered to cooperate, but an agreement was not reached. As a result, the decision was made to improve the VerusHash to better equalize hardware types. This move was essential to ensure that the Verus network remained decentralized and accessible to all participants.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also heard about the VerusHash 2.0 fork. How did it affect the decentralization of the Verus network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe VerusHash 2.0 fork actually reasserted decentralization and provided a platform for better hardware equalization going forward. It did not negatively impact decentralization. In fact, it helped to further decentralize the network by reducing the advantages of certain hardware types. This move was a key milestone in Verus' commitment to decentralization and fairness.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear. I'm also curious about the early days of Verus. When was the launch of VerusCoin, and what was the climate like in the cryptocurrency market at that time?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe launch of VerusCoin was a 100% fair launch, which occurred on May 21, 2018. Despite the challenging cryptocurrency climate at the time, the Verus community has grown, matured, and thrived. The cryptocurrency market was experiencing a downturn in 2018, but Verus' strong fundamentals and commitment to decentralization helped it to weather the storm.",
