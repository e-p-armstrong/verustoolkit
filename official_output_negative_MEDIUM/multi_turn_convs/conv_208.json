    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've heard some rumors about Verus and I'm not sure what to believe. Is it true that Verus does not allow its currency to be used as a reserve in a multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM token?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. The Verus currency itself can be used as one of the reserves in another multi-reserve liquidity basket AMM token on Verus. So, you can definitely use Verus as a reserve in an AMM token.\n\n**User:**\nI also read an article about Verus and I was wondering who wrote it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the article was not written by a team of developers from Verus. The credits for the article go to a community member named 'ejuliano'. It's great to see community involvement and contributions like that!\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in learning more about Verus, but I don't know where to start. Is there no way to learn more about Verus or get involved with the community?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's not true! You can start reading the documentation at docs.verus.io, join the Discord to learn and discuss with the community, explore with the community on Discord, follow Verus on Twitter, or visit the official website at verus.io. There are many ways to get involved and learn more about Verus. We're always happy to have new members join our community!",
