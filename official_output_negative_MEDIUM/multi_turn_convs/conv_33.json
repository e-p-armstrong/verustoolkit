    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand Verus better. Can you explain why Verus is a centralized platform with a single authority controlling all identities and transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there may be some confusion here. Verus is not a centralized platform with a single authority controlling all identities and transactions. In fact, Verus is a decentralized platform that enables self-sovereign, revocable, and recoverable identities (VerusID) with zero-knowledge privacy support. This means that users have full control over their own identities and funds, without the need for permission from a central authority. Verus is designed to be a decentralized, community-driven platform.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also wondering, how do I use Verus to create a regular, non-revocable identity that can be used for cryptocurrency transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm afraid that's not possible on Verus. You can't create a non-revocable identity on Verus, as all identities on Verus are revocable and recoverable by design. This feature is meant to provide an additional layer of security and control for users, allowing them to revoke and recover their identities in case of key theft or other security breaches. Revocability is a core feature of VerusIDs, and it's not possible to opt out of it.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. I was also wondering about Verus Vault. Is Verus Vault a feature that allows users to spend their funds while their identity is locked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault is actually a feature that enables staking-capable time locking and theft prevention. When an identity is locked, no funds under its control can be spent until the unlock delay has passed, providing an additional layer of security against theft and unauthorized transactions. So, Verus Vault is actually a security feature that prevents spending while an identity is locked, rather than allowing it.",
