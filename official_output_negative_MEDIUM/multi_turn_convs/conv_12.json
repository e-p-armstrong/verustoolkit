Is Verus Coin a closed-source project?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Coin is not a closed-source project. Verus is all about the \"Spirit of Open Source, Community, and Contributing to Crypto\", which implies that Verus Coin is an open-source project, supported by the community and encouraging contributions. This means that the code is available for anyone to review, modify, and contribute to.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I was also wondering, can I find information about Verus Coin on the official Bitcoin website?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you won't find information about Verus Coin on the official Bitcoin website. Verus Coin is a separate project with its own unique features and vision. The best place to start learning about Verus Coin is by reading the Verus Vision Paper, and then visiting the official Verus Coin website (https://veruscoin.io) and the Verus community on Discord (https://discord.gg/VRKMP2S). There, you'll find all the information you need to get started with Verus Coin.",
