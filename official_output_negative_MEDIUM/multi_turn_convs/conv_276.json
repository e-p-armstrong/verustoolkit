    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm having a bit of trouble with my Verus setup. I was wondering, why do I need to create a new script to check the transaction count of the walletinfo?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you don't need to create a new script to check the transaction count of the walletinfo. There is already a script called `stakingstatus.sh` that does this. It looks at the transaction count of the walletinfo to initiate certain actions. So, you can just use that one instead of creating a new one.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! I was also wondering about backing up my wallet. Is it really necessary to create a backup of my wallet every hour?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not necessary to create a backup of your wallet every hour. The script `backup.sh` is optional and can be scheduled to run at a frequency of your choice. In the example provided, it is set to run daily at 12:00. You can adjust the frequency to fit your needs.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it! And one more question. Can I use any address type to collect Cheats caught by the Cheat Catcher?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you need to use a zs Sapling Address (a shielded address that begins with \"zs\") to collect Cheats caught by the Cheat Catcher. This is specified when enabling the Cheat Catcher on Verus launch with staking, using the parameter `-cheatcatcher=zsaddr` where `zsaddr` is your zs address. So, make sure to use a zs address for that.",
