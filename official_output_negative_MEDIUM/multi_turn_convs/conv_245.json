    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Community Contributed Value (CommCurr) systems on the Verus network, and I'm a bit confused. How does the Verus network charge a flat fee of $10,000 to set up a CommCurr system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. The Verus network does not charge a flat fee of $10,000 to set up a CommCurr system. In fact, the minimal network costs to set this up on the Verus network would amount to less than $200, which is paid to the miners and stakers as block rewards for mining the Verus blockchain and powering all the community's transactions.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, thanks for the correction. I also had another question about CommCurr systems on the Verus network. Are they completely opaque and non-auditable?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, CommCurr systems on the Verus network are actually transparent and auditable, being on a public blockchain. Community members would have instant access to all relevant information about currency supplies, reserves, spending, conversion, etc. by the CommCurr creators. So, everything is out in the open and easily verifiable.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great, thanks for the clarification. One more question, I was worried about privacy on the Verus network. Does Verus not support private transactions, leaving community members' spending habits completely exposed?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus, being a fork of zcash, does offer private transactions on its native currency, Verus. This means there are methods for users (or preferably, their apps) to help protect the spending privacy of community members. So, you don't have to worry about your spending habits being exposed.",
