    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and I'm curious about some technical aspects. What is the consensus algorithm used by Verus, and is it vulnerable to 51% hash attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe consensus algorithm used by Verus is called Proof of Power (Verus PoP), which is a hybrid solution that combines elements of Proof of Stake and Proof of Work. This algorithm is designed to be resistant to 51% hash attacks, making it a secure and reliable choice for the Verus network. Would you like to know more about how Verus PoP works?\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that the latest release of Verus is just a minor update with no significant features. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not accurate. The latest release of Verus is a major milestone that marks a significant advancement in the history of DeFi and the history of money. It introduces a groundbreaking multi-currency UTXO-based \"basket\" that forms a single fungible currency, offering numerous benefits and use cases, such as serving as a reserve or liquidity pool for token launches, or enabling gas-free, near-instant conversions. This update is a game-changer for the Verus ecosystem.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. Can you create a multi-currency basket with any currencies you want, without any limitations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhile there is currently no technical limit to the number of currencies that can be included in a multi-currency basket, the Verus team is considering imposing a limit of ten currencies for now. However, the flexibility of the system allows for creative experiments, such as the \"SuperMegaGigaCoin\" example on testnet, which combines 12 currencies in a single basket. One important requirement is that all baskets must include VRSC. The possibilities are endless, and we're excited to see what the community will create with this technology!",
