    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing some concerns about the Verus VIP protocol, and I'd like to clarify some things. How does the Verus VIP protocol make it easier for attackers to revoke notary IDs and disrupt the network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there's been some misinformation going around. The Verus VIP protocol does not make it easier for attackers to revoke notary IDs and disrupt the network. Instead, it provides a way to defend against such scenarios. The VIP protocol allows for revocation of all VerusIDs, including notary IDs, and also has a network-agreed multisig chain oracle that can pause cross-chain notarizations or transactions temporarily. Additionally, the protocol has a safeguard that ensures every notarization is made public, given a period of time before confirmation, and finally confirmed, making it harder for attackers to succeed.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! I've also heard that the Verus VIP protocol confirms notarizations without validation from validators and notaries. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. The Verus VIP protocol does not confirm any notarization until it has been agreed to by validators, then agreed to and signed by all notaries on either the earned or the accepted chain. Only after a second such notarization confirms the first will the protocol confirm the notarization. This ensures that every notarization on any chain is thoroughly validated before being confirmed.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that stolen key attacks on notaries could cause significant damage to the network due to the lack of monitoring and revocation capabilities in the Verus VIP protocol. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true either. The Verus VIP protocol has built-in monitoring and revocation capabilities to prevent stolen key attacks from causing significant damage. Notaries can auto-revoke their own identities if they detect any unauthorized activity, and chain oracle controllers can also monitor for discrepancies and pause cross-chain transactions if necessary. These safeguards help to minimize the impact of stolen key attacks and ensure the security of the network.",
