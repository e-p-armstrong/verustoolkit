    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been wondering, why does Verus only allow users to create their own ERC20 tokens, but not full-fledged blockchains?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not correct. Verus enables users to create not only their own token currencies but also full-fledged, multi-currency, ID-issuing blockchains. These blockchains can send and receive from the Verus chain that launched them, and they even have the option to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I've also heard that all PBaaS chains require their own separate daemons to operate. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. All PBaaS chains can run from the same daemon. This allows projects to join the worldwide Verus community in improving the daemon, and they will start with a complete, multi-currency, ID-capable blockchain with DeFi capabilities that is merge-mineable and stakeable with other blockchains in the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nHow does Verus DeFi handle miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running in its currency conversions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus DeFi addresses the problems of miner extracted value (MEV) and front-running by ensuring that all currency conversions that use a particular liquidity pool and are mined into one block are solved and priced simultaneously. This provides fee-based DeFi integrated incentives to miners, stakers, and liquidity providers, ensuring smooth consensus operation and fee conversion capabilities by integrating DeFi liquidity pools directly into the consensus and cross-chain bridge protocols.\n\n**User:**\nAnd finally, I was wondering about the Ethereum bridge on Verus. Is it a centralized gateway?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Ethereum bridge on Verus is a decentralized gateway. It will launch shortly after PBaaS activates on mainnet, and it will include a 1:1 provably mapped currency called \u201cvETH\u201d on the Verus network, also available to all PBaaS chains. Additionally, it will feature a 100% backed basket of 33% Verus, 33% Ethereum, and 33% DAI, which will have auto-conversion of fees from Verus <-> Ethereum when sending cross-chain, based on the on-chain conversion price in the liquidity pool.",
