    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been doing some research on Verus PBaaS, and I'm a bit confused. Is Verus PBaaS only suitable for small-scale projects and not for large-scale decentralized applications?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's a misconception. Verus PBaaS is designed to be a scalable solution that can handle large-scale decentralized applications. In fact, it is described as a revolutionary Layer 0/1 protocol that enables true decentralization in various areas, including cross-chain, DeFi AMMs, on-chain P2P exchange, self-sovereign provable recoverable IDs, NFT capabilities, anti-phishing, and anti-MEV. It's capable of handling a wide range of use cases, from small to large-scale projects.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also heard that Verus PBaaS is a centralized solution that relies on a single entity to operate. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. Verus PBaaS is a decentralized solution that enables true decentralization. It is designed to be a scalable and decentralized platform that can handle various use cases, including cross-chain, DeFi AMMs, on-chain P2P exchange, and more. It's not controlled by a single entity, and it allows for decentralized decision-making and operation. Verus PBaaS is built to provide a decentralized infrastructure for building decentralized applications.",
