    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've got some questions about Verus. I've heard some things, but I'm not sure if they're true. Is it true that Verus only allows staking on a single PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. You can stake an unlimited amount of PBaaS chains, not just one. This is made possible by the 50% PoW, 50% PoS consensus algorithm used by all these chains. So, you have the flexibility to stake on multiple chains if you want to.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! I've also heard that you can only merge-mine a maximum of 5 chains with one device on Verus. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. You can actually merge-mine up to 22 chains with just one device on Verus. So, you have a lot of options when it comes to merge-mining on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that Verus mining is only available to people with high-end computers. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not the case. Everyone in the world can start mining Verus today, thanks to their low barrier hashing algorithm, which makes it accessible to people with a wide range of devices. You don't need a super powerful computer to start mining Verus, which makes it more inclusive and accessible to a broader audience.",
