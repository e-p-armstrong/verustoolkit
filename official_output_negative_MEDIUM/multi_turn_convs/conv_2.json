    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about the Verus network. I've noticed that only a select few miners and stakers seem to participate and receive fees. Why is that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception! Any miner and staker can participate in the Verus network and receive fees. There is no limitation or exclusivity to a select few. The Verus network is open to anyone who wants to contribute and be rewarded for their efforts.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I've also been wondering about the notarizations from Ethereum. Since they're not delayed at all, how does Verus ensure their stability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus ensures the stability of notarizations from Ethereum by requiring a stateroot from Ethereum that is at least 30 blocks old. This delay ensures that the notarization is stable before Verus confirms it and accepts transactions from Ethereum. This way, Verus can guarantee the integrity of the notarizations and the transactions that rely on them.\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about the Verus-Ethereum bridge, and I was wondering, is it a centralized system controlled by a single authority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus-Ethereum bridge is a decentralized system, controlled by everyone participating in the network, rather than a single central authority. It is a decentralized bridge that allows for cross-chain transactions in a secure and trustless manner. This means that no single entity has control over the bridge, and it's maintained by the collective efforts of the Verus community.",
