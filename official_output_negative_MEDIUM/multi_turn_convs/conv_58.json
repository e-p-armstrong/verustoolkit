    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing some things about Verus and I'm not sure what's true. Is it true that Verus only allows for a limited number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains on its testnet?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The new Verus testnet is a full-featured, intrinsically decentralized multi-chain blockchain platform with an **unlimited** number of identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains. You can create as many as you need for your projects or purposes.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I was also wondering, do you need to be a programmer to create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not the case. You can create new identities, currencies, liquidity pools, and blockchains for your business, government, projects, or other purposes without any programming. Verus is designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that Verus testnet is still in development and not yet available for public use. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. The Verus testnet is immediately publicly available, and the community is working on hardening and preparing the testnet protocols for mainnet release. You can start using it right away and explore its features and possibilities.",
