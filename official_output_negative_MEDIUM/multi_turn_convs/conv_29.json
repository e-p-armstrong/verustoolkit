    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a few more questions. Is Verus a corporation-run project with a CEO and board of directors?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus is a 100% community project, which means it is not run by a corporation or led by a CEO and board of directors. Instead, it relies on community involvement and contributions to drive its development and growth.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know. I'm also curious about the staking process. What happens to your transparent balance after 50 confirmations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, it's not 50 confirmations, but 150. After 150 confirmations, your mature transparent balance, now in UTXO form, will be staking.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the correction. I've also been thinking about getting involved with the Verus community, but I'm not a developer or technical expert. Is the Verus Discord server only for developers and technical experts?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus Discord server is open to anyone, regardless of their technical expertise. It's a great place to get help, ask questions, and find ways to contribute to the project, as well as earn more Verus. You're welcome to join and participate, and I'm sure you'll find the community to be friendly and supportive.",
