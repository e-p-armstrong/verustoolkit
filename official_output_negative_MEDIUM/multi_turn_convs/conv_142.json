    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I'm interested in launching a new currency on the Verus mainnet. How do I do that using the command-line interface?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nTo launch a new currency on the Verus mainnet, you would use a command similar to `./verus getcurrency \"MyBrand\"`. Note that you would omit the `-chain=VRSCTEST` flag, as this is only necessary for the testnet. Have you tried this command before, or do you have any questions about the process?\n\n**User:**\nI'm also curious about building on the Verus Protocol. Do I need to learn Solidity and hire smart contract auditors to do so?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need to learn Solidity or hire smart contract auditors to build on the Verus Protocol. Building with Verus is better, faster, cheaper, and more secure than other options, and you can focus on building the application layer without worrying about these complexities. Verus takes care of the underlying infrastructure, so you can focus on your project's logic and user experience. Does that make sense?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear. One more thing - I've heard that the Verus Protocol is only suitable for small-scale projects and personal use cases. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. The Verus Protocol is suitable for a wide range of use cases, including large-scale businesses and organizations. It is designed to support a variety of applications, including launching powerful currencies for brands, businesses, communities, and organizations. Verus is a robust and scalable solution that can handle complex use cases, so you can build with confidence. Do you have any other questions about building on Verus?",
