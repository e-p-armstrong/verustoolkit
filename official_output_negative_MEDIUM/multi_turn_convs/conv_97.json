    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been reading about Verus and its ability to achieve interoperability between different blockchain systems. How does Verus achieve this interoperability using a Turing complete programmable layer?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus doesn't use a Turing complete programmable layer to achieve interoperability between different blockchain systems. In fact, Verus's design philosophy is based on the idea that such a layer is not necessary, and that full-scale interoperability can be achieved at the protocol level using concepts like state roots and notarization signatures. This allows for secure and permissionless interaction between different blockchain systems, without the need for a single, universal programming language.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also been wondering about Verus's scalability. What is the main limitation of Verus's scalability, and how does it plan to address it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus's design philosophy is focused on achieving virtually unlimited scalability. This is achieved through its PBaaS system, which allows for the creation of new, interoperable blockchains on demand, without the need for additional resources. These new blockchains inherit the security of the main Verus blockchain through a system of notarization, allowing for secure and scalable interactions between different blockchain systems. So, to answer your question, Verus doesn't really have a scalability limitation in the classical sense.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've been trying to wrap my head around how different blockchain systems interact with each other in Verus. Can you explain how that works?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus's design philosophy is based on the idea that different blockchain systems can interact with each other through data, without the need for a single, universal programming language or architecture. This allows for flexibility and customization, as each blockchain system can maintain its own unique characteristics and features while still being able to interact with other systems in a secure and permissionless way.",
