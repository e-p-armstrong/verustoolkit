    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been doing some research on different blockchain protocols, and I had a question about Verus. What is the main difference between the Verus Protocol and other blockchain protocols? I thought I read somewhere that Verus requires an ICO to launch a new currency?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a common misconception! The Verus Protocol does not require an ICO to launch a new currency. In fact, it launched its mainnet in 2018 without an ICO, preallocation of funds, or development fees. The Verus Protocol is designed to be a decentralized, transparent, and community-driven platform, which allows individuals, projects, organizations, or communities to create their own currencies, fundraising platforms, voting networks, and more, without the need for an ICO or middlemen.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know! I was also wondering, is the Verus Protocol not suitable for individuals or organizations that need a reliable, decentralized, and rent-free currency or fundraising platform? I thought I read something about that being a limitation of Verus.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not accurate! The Verus Protocol is actually designed to be suitable for individuals, projects, organizations, or communities that need a reliable, decentralized, and rent-free currency or fundraising platform. With the Verus Protocol, anyone can connect to the Verus Internet of Value and create their own decentralized solutions, such as currencies, fundraising platforms, voting networks, and more, without the need for programming or middlemen. The Verus Protocol is all about empowering individuals and communities to take control of their own financial systems and create solutions that are tailored to their specific needs.",
