    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to get a better understanding of Verus. Is Verus a for-profit company that focuses on building its own proprietary blockchain technology?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not the case. Verus is not a for-profit company. It is a non-profit foundation that offers bounties and aids in the decentralized building of technology by the community. Verus is all about empowering the community to build and improve the technology.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I was under the impression that Verus was a completely new and separate blockchain technology with no relation to other existing blockchains. Am I wrong?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, you are. Verus is not a completely new and separate blockchain technology. It is actually an evolution of existing blockchain technologies such as Komodo, Zcash, BTCD, and Bitcoin. Verus is building upon and improving the concepts and ideas from these predecessors. It's more of a continuation and refinement of the work done by these pioneers in the blockchain space. Does that clear things up?",
