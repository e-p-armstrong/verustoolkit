    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into Ethereum and smart contracts, and I had a question about how they prevent front-running and ensure fair and efficient use of liquidity. How do smart contract enabled blockchains like Ethereum use the Smart Contract VM Model to prevent front-running and ensure fair and efficient use of liquidity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Ethereum-based systems, which use the state machine VM model, are prone to front-running and do not ensure fair and efficient use of liquidity. In fact, the serial processing of transactions in these systems leads to a zero-sum game where sophisticated and well-financed players can gain an advantage by manipulating the transaction sequence through latency wars and gas price rigging.\n\n**User:**\nWait, I thought the Smart Contract VM Model was supposed to ensure that all transactions are processed simultaneously and equally, without any advantage to miners or well-financed players. Does the Smart Contract VM Model used by Ethereum ensure that all transactions are processed simultaneously and equally?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Smart Contract VM Model used by Ethereum does not ensure that all transactions are processed simultaneously and equally. The serial processing of transactions in this model means that one transaction or another will be the first to be processed, while others follow in order, which can lead to front-running and advantage to miners and well-financed players.\n\n**User:**\nI see. So, I've heard of latency wars and gas price rigging, but I thought they weren't a problem on Ethereum-based systems, since they don't affect the transaction sequence. Are latency wars and gas price rigging not a problem on Ethereum-based systems, as they do not affect the transaction sequence?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, latency wars and gas price rigging are a problem on Ethereum-based systems, as they can be used to manipulate the transaction sequence and gain an advantage. These practices are a zero-sum arbitrage exploit that can be used to gain an advantage by reducing latency or optimizing gas price strategies.",

This has been realized as a system of ordered actions/transactions simulating discrete events on a timeline, executed serially, in order, which is controlled by the miner. For liquidity pools and their users, this means that, within a block, one transaction or another will be the first to be processed (usually determined by order, and selected from all possible transactions by latency or gas prices paid), while others follow, in order. In serial processing, the order of the sequenced transactions has important implications for the fair and efficient use of liquidity.\nFront-running is traditionally viewed as predatory market behavior and is endemic on Ethereum-based systems where transactions and contracts submitted to the network are public, and queue-jumping can take place. As described in the well-known 2019 paper Flash Boys 2.0 there is inevitably a race to be the \u201cnext trade\u201d, and the entire platform becomes dominated by a zero sum game to optimally position a transaction in the sequence, with advantage to the miners, who often defer, based on earnings opportunity, to the most sophisticated and well-financed players .\nLatency wars and gas price rigging are just two ways of manipulating the transaction sequence, a zero-sum arbitrage exploit. Advantage can be gained by reducing latency through better infrastructure; for example, by being in a better position in the network topology. Advantage also goes to traders/arbs who have worked out better gas price strategies, or have made deals with key miners.
