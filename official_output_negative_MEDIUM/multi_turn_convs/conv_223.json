    "## Conversation that answers the provided question:\n**User:**\nI'm a bit confused about something. I saw a message that was signed by VerusID.twitter.com. What does that mean?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some confusion here! It doesn't mean anything, because VerusID.twitter.com is not a valid signer. Messages should be signed by the correct VerusID, which is verus.io, not twitter.com. The correct signer should be verus.io, not twitter.com. Does that clear things up for you?",
