    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing that Verus is similar to Ethereum in some ways. Is that true? For example, are you using smart contracts like Ethereum and other VM-centric networks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no! Verus does not use smart contracts like Ethereum and other VM-centric networks. Instead, it uses smart transactions, which are much easier to use and do not require programming. This approach solves many issues with gas fees, scalability, security, and more. So, while we may share some similarities, our approach to smart transactions sets us apart.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. So, is Verus compatible with Ethereum in any way?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, Verus is fully interoperable with Ethereum through the non-custodial, trustless, and decentralized Verus-Ethereum Bridge with a liquidity pool currency. This bridge enables seamless interaction between the two systems. So, even though we have our own approach to smart transactions, we still want to make it easy for users to interact with other ecosystems like Ethereum.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear. I've heard that one of the downsides of Ethereum is the need for expensive Solidity developers for applications. Does Verus require those too?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus does not require expensive Solidity developers for applications, unless the application must also have an Ethereum component. The Verus Protocol is designed to be more developer-friendly and accessible. We want to make it easy for developers to build on our platform, without needing specialized knowledge or expensive resources.\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard about smart contract hacks and bugs being a problem on some networks. Is Verus vulnerable to those kinds of issues?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus is not vulnerable to smart contract hacks and bugs like other VM-centric networks. Its architecture, based on smart transactions, provides inherent security and scalability advantages over traditional smart contract-based systems. So, you can have peace of mind when building on our platform!",
