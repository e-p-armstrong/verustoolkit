    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been wondering about the story behind the development of open source FPGA mining software for Verus Coin. Can you tell me how the company behind the FPGA bitstream and secret mining community worked with the Verus Coin community to develop it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not exactly what happened. The company behind the FPGA bitstream and secret mining community did not come to an agreement with the Verus Coin community to work together on open source FPGA mining software. As a result, the Verus team made the decision to fork to a newly developed algorithm, VerusHash 2.0.\n\n**User:**\nInteresting. So, what was the main purpose of designing the VerusHash algorithm?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe main purpose of designing the VerusHash algorithm was not to favor one type of hardware over another, but to ensure that the proof of work measurement is economically comparable across as many types of hardware as possible, with a total of the broadest distribution possible.\n\n**User:**\nDid the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm allow for mining by FPGAs and ASICs from the start?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was only mineable by CPU hardware initially, with GPUs to follow soon after. FPGAs and ASICs were not supported from the start.\n\n**User:**\nWhat about the performance of GPUs on the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm? What was expected?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAccording to early reports, the expected performance of optimized GPUs on the VerusHash 2.0 algorithm was likely to range from the low to the middle-high range of CPU price/performance, landing solidly on the low end.",
