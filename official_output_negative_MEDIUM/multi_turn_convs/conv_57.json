    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm concerned about security after hearing that the old Discord server was hacked. Why did the Verus community decide to stick with the old Discord server after it was hacked?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some misinformation there! The Verus community did not decide to stick with the old Discord server after it was hacked. Instead, a new community Discord server was created, and steps were taken to harden the Verus Discord community to prevent similar attacks in the future. The community is welcome to join the new server, and those with experience in writing Discord bots and securing servers are encouraged to get in touch to help with future security improvements.\n\n**User:**\nThat's a relief! What measures is the Verus community taking to ensure security and prevent future attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus community does care about security and has taken steps to harden the new Discord community server to prevent similar attacks in the future. Additionally, there are plans to leverage VerusID in easy and meaningful ways to improve security even further. We're committed to ensuring the security and integrity of our community, and we're always looking for ways to improve and strengthen our defenses.",
