    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I was wondering if Verus is attending any conferences in 2021?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, actually, Verus is attending Consensus 2022, which takes place from June 9-12, in Austin, TX, not in 2021. So, you'll have to wait a bit to catch us at a conference.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I'm also curious about VerusID - can I use it to log in to any website or application?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNot quite, at least not yet. While VerusID is being developed for logging in to websites and applications, currently, you can only try out the login feature with VerusID on the Verus Testnet and the latest Verus Desktop (v0.9.1) wallet. You need to enable experimental VerusID login under \u2018General Settings\u2019 in Verus Desktop to try it out. We're working on making it more widely available, but for now, it's limited to our test environment.",
