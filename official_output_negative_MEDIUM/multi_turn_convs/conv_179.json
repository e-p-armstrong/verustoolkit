    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand how smart contracts work in Verus. Do users typically need to write and deploy their own custom smart contracts in order to use them?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, users don't need to write and deploy their own custom smart contracts in Verus. Smart contract capabilities are primitives built into the protocol, and users can interact with them through simple transactions using a command-line API or a few clicks in the GUI wallet. There are no intervening smart contracts to audit or worry about. It's designed to be user-friendly and accessible.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I was also wondering about how Verus processes transactions. How does it work, and what impact does this have on the fairness of conversions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus processes all transactions aggregated according to the protocol in parallel, which means that the specific order within a block has no impact on the fairness of any conversion. This design allows for simultaneous solving of submitted transactions in any group of transactions, ensuring that all conversions in all directions get exactly the same conversion price, without even a spread between conversions to and from a specific currency.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really efficient and fair. But I was wondering, wouldn't that require a significant change to the protocol? I thought Verus currently used serial processing for transactions.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus protocol doesn't need to be modified to support simultaneous solving of transactions in a group because it already does that. The protocol is designed to process all transactions aggregated according to the protocol in parallel, which allows for simultaneous solving of submitted transactions in any group of transactions. This fundamental design difference enables the fairness and efficiency of conversions in Verus. So, no changes are needed!",
