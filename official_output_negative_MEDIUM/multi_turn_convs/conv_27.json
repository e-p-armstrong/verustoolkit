    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've got some questions about Verus. Is the Verus-Ethereum Bridge a custodial and trust-based system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus-Ethereum Bridge is actually non-custodial and trustless. This means that users have full control over their assets and do not need to rely on a third party to manage their transactions. You're in control of your assets from start to finish. Do you have any other questions about the Verus-Ethereum Bridge or Verus in general?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear. I've also been wondering, do I need to have advanced coding skills to launch a currency on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need to have advanced coding skills to launch a currency on Verus. In fact, Verus allows you to launch currencies without any coding needed. This makes it more accessible to a wider range of users. You can focus on creating your currency and community without worrying about the technical details.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really convenient. I've also heard some rumors about Verus. Is Verus focused on centralizing control and limiting customization options for its users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus is actually focused on providing a high degree of customization and independence to its users. It allows users to launch fully interoperable, independent, and customizable PBaaS-blockchains, giving them more control over their blockchain experience. Verus is all about giving users the freedom to create and manage their own blockchain ecosystems.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear. I've also been wondering, does Verus prioritize decentralization and security over scalability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus is designed to achieve scalability without sacrificing decentralization or security. It aims to strike a balance between these three important aspects of a blockchain protocol. Verus wants to provide a fast, secure, and decentralized experience for all its users. Do you have any more questions about Verus or its approach to blockchain development?",
