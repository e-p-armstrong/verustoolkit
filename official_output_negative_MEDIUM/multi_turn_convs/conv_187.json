    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm a bit confused about Verus and its relationship with fractional reserve currencies. Can you help clarify something for me? Why can't Verus be converted to native fractional reserve currencies through manual transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's a misconception! Verus can be converted to native fractional reserve currencies through simple transactions and PBaaS reserve protocols in a fully automatic way, at any time and for virtually any volume. There is no need for manual transactions. Verus is designed to be flexible and adaptable, and this is just one example of that.\n\n**User:**\nHmm, I see. I thought I read somewhere that Verus fractional reserve currencies aren't native to Verus PBaaS chains. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not accurate. Verus fractional reserve currencies are, in fact, the native currencies of Verus PBaaS chains that choose to share liquidity across the Verus ecosystem. They're an integral part of the Verus system and are designed to work seamlessly with PBaaS chains.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. One more question: Will Verus PBaaS chains not have control over Verus Coin reserves on the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus PBaaS chains that are launched as Verus fractional reserves will indeed control a certain amount of Verus Coin on the Verus blockchain, which will serve as the reserves for those chains. So, yes, they will have control over those reserves.",
