    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm curious about the economics of Verus. Why do miners and stakers only receive a block reward, with no additional compensation for processing transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not the case. Miners and stakers do receive additional compensation for processing transactions. In addition to the block reward, they are also rewarded with the fees users pay to have their transactions processed by the network. These fees, along with other fees such as ID registration costs, go into a fee pool, and each miner or staker gets to take 1% of what is in the fee pool along with their block reward.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. What happens to the fees collected from transactions and ID registrations?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe fees collected from transactions and ID registrations go into a fee pool. This fee pool is then distributed among miners and stakers, who each receive 1% of the fee pool along with their block reward. This distribution system helps to stabilize mining and staking proceeds over time and aligns incentives to prevent malicious behavior.\n\n**User:**\nI'm interested in staking, but I have my funds in a private address (z-address). Can I stake my funds from there?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you cannot stake your funds from a private address (z-address). Only funds in a transparent address are eligible for staking. Additionally, any funds received, transacted with, or staked within the last 150 blocks are also not eligible for staking.\n\n**User:**\nI set up staking, but it's not working. What should I do if I'm experiencing issues with staking?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIf you're experiencing issues with staking, there are a few things you should check. First, check your eligible staking balance, making sure you're not trying to stake funds from a private address or funds that are too recent. Next, ensure that staking is enabled in your wallet. You can do this using the `getmininginfo` command. Finally, check your system clock to ensure your time is accurate. If you're still having issues, you may want to seek help from the Verus community or staking channels on Discord.",
