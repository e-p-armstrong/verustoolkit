    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating my own blockchain on Verus. What is the minimum number of public nodes required to start a chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe minimum number of public nodes required to start a chain is 2. You need to provide two public nodes to start your chain. Do you have any other questions about setting up your own blockchain?\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Is it possible to launch a blockchain without manual intervention?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrently, manual intervention is required to provide initial nodes to start a chain. However, this step will be automated soon, eliminating the need for manual intervention. We're working hard to make it easier for users to launch their own blockchains!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that makes sense. How many confirmations are required for your chain to be visible to everyone on the test-net?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOnly one confirmation is required for your chain to be visible to everyone on the test-net. Once the transaction that created your chain gets one confirmation, it will be visible on the discover page or can be searched for on the connect page. It's pretty straightforward!\n\n**User:**\nI've also heard that I can mine and stake other coins on Verus. Is that true? Can I only mine and stake my own project?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you can mine and stake up to 14 other coins in addition to your own project, earning cryptocurrency while helping other teams and realizing your own unique vision. Verus is all about community and collaboration, so we encourage users to support each other's projects!",
