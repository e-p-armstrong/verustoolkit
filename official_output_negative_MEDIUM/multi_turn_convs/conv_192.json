    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been trying to figure out how Verus Vault works. Can you explain how it allows you to spend funds from a locked VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus Vault doesn't allow you to spend funds from a locked VerusID. In fact, when you lock a VerusID, its funds cannot be spent anymore. This is a security feature designed to protect your funds. The locking and unlocking of a VerusID are visible on the blockchain, and there are two lock mechanisms available: locking until a predetermined number of blocks have passed, and locking with a delay.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also trying to figure out the `makeoffer` command. What's the main purpose of that command?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe `makeoffer` command is used to create an offer that specifies what you want to offer (funds, VerusIDs, or currencies) and what you want in return. There are other commands, such as `takeoffer`, `getoffers`, `closeoffers`, and `listopenoffers`, that interact with offers in different ways.\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. Does Verus Vault provide a way to unlock a VerusID without the revocation and recovery authorities?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Verus Vault does not provide a way to unlock a VerusID without the revocation and recovery authorities. The two lock mechanisms used by Verus Vault cannot be circumvented by anyone, except the revocation and recovery authorities together.",
