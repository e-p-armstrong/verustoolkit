    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about the notarization process in Verus. How does it work without requiring any agreement from notary witnesses?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the notarization process does require agreement from notary witnesses. After an earned notarization has been agreed to by a new earned notarization, notary witnesses sign to signify they agree with the notarization as well. Although they can disagree with a signature, no signature is also a valid way to disagree. The agreement from notary witnesses is an essential step in the notarization process. \n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I was also wondering about the differences between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization. What's the primary difference between them in terms of evidence required?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe primary difference between notary confirm notarization and auto-notarization is that they require different amounts and types of evidence. Notary confirm notarization always requires a quorum of signatures from the specified notaries, whereas auto-notarization requires more multi-stage evidence in the face of randomized proof selection, potential fraud proofs, and disagreements.\n\n**User:**\nLastly, I was wondering about fully decentralized gateways and how they operate when it comes to cryptographic proofs. Can you explain that to me?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI apologize, but I don't have a accurate answer to that question. The original answer was incorrect and did not address the question. I'd be happy to help you find the correct information or provide a new answer that accurately addresses the question.",

If the prior accepted notarization it agrees with is not yet confirmed, then it may be considered newly confirmed.\n2. Once an earned notarization has been agreed to by a new earned notarization, alternating between PoW and PoS blocks to help further decentralized requirements for agreement, and by following all notarization rules, notary witnesses may sign signifying they agree with the notarization as well. Although they can disagree with a signature, no signature is also a valid way to disagree.\n3. After validators and notary witnesses have agreed, or in the case of auto-notarization, a longer validation period with more agreement has passed, the prior notarization agreed with by a new notarization that has passed all necessary agreement, is confirmed.
