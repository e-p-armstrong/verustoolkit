    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I've got some questions about bridging ETH, DAI, or MKR to the Verus blockchain. I've heard it only takes 10 minutes for them to arrive in my wallet. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI think there might be some misinformation there. Actually, it can take up to 45 minutes for bridged ETH, DAI, or MKR to arrive on the Verus blockchain and in your wallet, not 10 minutes. It's good you're doing your research, though!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, thanks for clarifying that. I was also wondering, how do you avoid paying high gas fees when bridging ETH, DAI, or MKR to the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the gas fee calculation is quite high, and it's possible that you may pay a lot less, but this is never a guarantee. There's no certain way to avoid paying high gas fees in this scenario. It's something to be aware of when bridging assets.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. Another question I had was about adding vETH, DAI.vETH, and MKR.vETH to my Verus Desktop wallet. Can I just click on the \"Add Currency\" button in the \"Wallet\" tab to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not that straightforward. To add vETH, DAI.vETH, and MKR.vETH to your Verus Desktop wallet, you need to go to the \"Multiverse\" tab, click on Verus on the left, click on one of the currencies, and then click the \"Add Currency\" button. After that, you can go back to the \"Wallet\" tab and see the added currencies in the dropdown.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what about the Verus Mobile wallet? Do I need to install it before I can add vETH, DAI.vETH, and MKR.vETH to it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe instructions assume that you already have the Verus Mobile wallet installed and are ready to go. If you haven't installed it, you'll need to do that first before you can add vETH, DAI.vETH, and MKR.vETH to it.",
