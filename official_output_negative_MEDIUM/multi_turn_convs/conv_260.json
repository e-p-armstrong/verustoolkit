    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been wondering how to create a currency on Ethereum using Verus. Since Verus doesn't support exporting currencies to other chains, is there a workaround?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus does support exporting currencies to other chains! If you launch a currency on Verus or any PBaaS chain, including the native PBaaS chain's currency, all of those currency definitions can be exported to Ethereum, and they will emerge on Ethereum as an automatically created and functional ERC20 contract, enabling the currency to be sent back and forth via protocol from then on.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! But I've always thought that IDs and currencies are tied to a specific chain, so they can't be used across multiple chains. Am I wrong?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYou're not entirely wrong, but there's more to it! IDs and currencies can be used across multiple chains. They can be created and launched on one chain, leveraging all of that chain's capabilities, and exported to other chains to be used everywhere across the network. This is possible because all identities and currencies are resolvable worldwide, meaning that you can determine a network path to the nodes of the blockchain where they were defined via their friendly name or i-address.\n\n**User:**\nAnother question I have is about MEV (Miner Extractable Value) in liquidity pools on Verus. Since it's not addressed in the protocol, how do you solve for it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus has solved for MEV-resistant (both intra and inter-block) Automated Market Makers (AMMs) as a primitive, available to all applications and users. This is possible because the currency and liquidity pool support is in the L1 protocol. So, you don't need to worry about MEV in liquidity pools on Verus!",
