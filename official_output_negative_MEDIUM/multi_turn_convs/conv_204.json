    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating a new blockchain on the Verus network. How do you create a new blockchain on the Verus network without a VerusID?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can't create a new blockchain on the Verus network without a VerusID. To create a new blockchain on the Verus network, you need to have the VerusID name of the chain. VerusIDs are necessary to launch a new chain, and each chain is independent and customizable. Do you have a VerusID set up?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I'm just exploring the possibilities of creating a new chain. I was wondering, can a PBaaS chain have a custom consensus mechanism?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNewly created PBaaS chains inherit the 50/50% PoW/PoS consensus mechanism from the main Verus blockchain. While this percentage might be customizable in the future, currently, PBaaS chains do not have custom consensus mechanisms. But that's a great idea, maybe we'll see that feature in the future!\n\n**User:**\nOkay, got it. And one more question: do miners need to create their own mining infrastructure to mine a newly created PBaaS chain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, miners do not need to create their own mining infrastructure to mine a newly created PBaaS chain. A miner in the VerusCoin ecosystem can mine up to 22 different PBaaS-chains without losing any of the original hash power, thanks to Merge-Mining. This means that the creator of the chain doesn't have to worry about creating their own mining infrastructure. It's a pretty convenient setup!",
