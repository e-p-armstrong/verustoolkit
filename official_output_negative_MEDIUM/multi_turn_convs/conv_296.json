    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm still getting familiar with Verus DeFi and I have a question. Why can't you use Ethereum currencies with Verus DeFi?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can use Ethereum currencies with Verus DeFi. All currencies on the Verus network, including those bridged over from Ethereum, can be used with Verus DeFi. So, you have the flexibility to work with a wide range of currencies within the Verus ecosystem. Do you have any other questions about Verus DeFi or how it works with different currencies?\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to know! I've also heard that Verus is only suitable for building small-scale applications. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true. Verus is not limited to building small-scale applications. Verus is suitable for building a wide range of applications, including eCommerce enabled supply chains, massively scalable ownership-based games, real-world asset eCommerce enabled networks, voting systems, identity management networks, communication networks, financial networks, and 3D metaverses with identities, brands, and ownership. Verus is a highly scalable platform that can support complex and large-scale applications. It's really versatile and can be used for a variety of use cases. Do you have any other questions about what you can build with Verus?",

Verus DeFi enables liquidity baskets of up to 10 underlying reserve currencies and can serve as a unique, self-balancing, MEV-resistant portfolio, a permissionless or permissioned ID registrar where fees go to the LPs of the basket, or an easy way to send from any reserve currency or the basket currency itself to any other without worrying about block builder reordering or MEV, as all conversions of a liquidity basket in any direction that are processed within one or more blocks are always solved simultaneously, no front and not back. Every conversion gets the same price in each direction with no spread and an ultra low fee (max. 0.05%), again, all part of the L1 consensus.\nWhether you plan to build eCommerce enabled supply chains, massively scalable ownership-based games, real world asset eCommerce enabled networks, voting systems, identity management networks, communication networks, financial networks, 3D metaverses with identities, brands, and ownership or just about any application for a better Web3 on the Internet of Value, you\u2019ll be left behind if you don\u2019t deep dive on Verus first.\nJoin us in the next crypto revolution.
