    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been looking into Verus and I'm curious about how it works with projects built on its network. How does Verus limit the capabilities of projects built on its network?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus doesn't limit the capabilities of projects built on its network. In fact, projects built on Verus can build faster, better, more secure apps and services with the possibility of provable identity + privacy, crowdfunded projects, businesses, economies, and public infrastructure efforts all seamlessly integrated into UIs. Verus is designed to empower projects, not restrict them.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! I've also been wondering about the Verus Internet Protocol (VIP). Is it a centralized cross-chain technology?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus Internet Protocol (VIP) is a fully decentralized, provable cross-chain technology. It is based on cryptographic proofs of each chain with optional witnesses to confirm chain state, making it a decentralized solution. This means that VIP operates without a central authority, which is an important aspect of Verus's commitment to decentralization.\n\n**User:**\nI've also got a question about VerusID. Does it only support a limited amount of provable data?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, VerusID Content Multimaps support unlimited provable data for every VerusID. This feature is retained in the upgrade and allows for a high degree of flexibility and customization in VerusID management. You can store as much provable data as you need, giving you a lot of flexibility and control over your VerusID. Do you have any more questions about Verus or VerusID?",
