    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHi, I have a few questions about Verus. First, what is the purpose of the monthly recap on Medium, and why is it not available through a newsletter?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the monthly recap on Medium is available through a newsletter as well. In fact, the same content is sent through the newsletter as is published on Medium. So, you can stay updated on Verus news and developments through either medium.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know, thanks! I was also wondering about the multi-chain testnet. Is it still active, and has the bridge to the Rinkeby testnet been released?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe multi-chain testnet has actually been reset in preparation for the bridge to the Rinkeby testnet. While it's said that the release is close, it hasn't happened yet. We're all waiting for the update, but it's not quite here yet.\n\n**User:**\nGot it, thanks for the update. I've also seen some mentions of Verus Desktop and CLI wallet updates. Are these updates mandatory for all users?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the Verus Desktop and CLI wallet updates are highly recommended but non-mandatory. However, they are critical for notaries and pools, so if you're involved in those areas, you should definitely make sure to update.\n\n**User:**\nOkay, that's good to know. I've heard some rumors about Verus being rejected from integrating with OpenID and Bluesky. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not true at all. Verus has actually been selected to start a workgroup to integrate with OpenID, and its lead developer Mike Toutonghi has had conversations with Bluesky about the benefits of integrating Verus and VerusID with their project. So, things are moving forward on that front!",
