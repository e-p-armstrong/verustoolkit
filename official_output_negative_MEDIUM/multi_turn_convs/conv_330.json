    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been thinking about mining VRSC and I was wondering, how can I mine VRSC on my computer using VerusBox?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, you can't mine VRSC on your computer using VerusBox. VerusBox is designed for mobile devices, specifically Android, and allows you to mine VRSC on your phone, not on your computer. If you're interested in mining VRSC, you'll need to explore other options.\n\n**User:**\nI was also curious about the team behind Verus. Is Mike Toutonghi the community manager of Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, Mike Toutonghi is not the community manager of Verus. He is actually the lead developer of Verus. He's been instrumental in shaping the project's technical direction.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. Has Mike Toutonghi provided any technical updates to the community?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, Mike Toutonghi has provided technical updates to the community. He's been quite active in keeping the community informed about the project's progress and has shared several updates on the technical aspects of Verus.",
