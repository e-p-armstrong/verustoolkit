    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about Verus' business model, specifically with regards to its liquidity services. How does Verus plan to charge high fees for its liquidity services, considering its goal of providing low-cost transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus doesn't plan to charge high fees for its liquidity services. In fact, its goal is to provide the lowest friction, lowest cost, lowest risk, and fairest conversion transactions for the crypto and wider financial communities. Verus is committed to keeping costs low to benefit its users.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear. I was also wondering about the advantages of traditional order-matching paradigms compared to automated market makers. What are the main advantages of traditional order-matching paradigms over automated market makers?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThere actually isn't an advantage of traditional order-matching paradigms over automated market makers. In fact, automated market makers are a new paradigm that replaces the order book with on-chain reserves, allowing asynchronous price discovery. They offer a more efficient and effective way of facilitating conversions.\n\n**User:**\nSo, automated market makers are a relatively new concept that has not yet been widely adopted?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, automated market makers are not a new concept. They were introduced to the Ethereum blockchain in 2017 and have since developed into a popular new paradigm for conversion of one financial instrument to another. They've been around for a while and have gained significant traction in the industry.",

            " emerge under low-cost conditions, and that this liquidity will provide the lowest friction, lowest cost, lowest risk, fairest conversion transactions for the crypto and wider financial communities.\nVerus is concurrently in the advanced stages of completing decentralized bridging technology which will allow other blockchain ecosystems (including Ethereum and its ERC-20s) to be represented on the Verus system in a decentralized manner.\nAutomated Market Makers and Community Driven Liquidity\nThe era of smart contract enabled blockchains, pioneered by Ethereum, has allowed the creation of new financial primitives. Among the most important of these are automated market makers. Brought to the Ethereum blockchain in 2017, they have developed into a popular new paradigm for conversion of one financial instrument to another. By attracting ERC20 holders to lock their tokens in so-called liquidity pools, the reserves in these pools act as an always-ready counterparty able to transact with any user at an algorithmically determined price. Prior to this, all price discovery in crypto markets had been through the bid/ask, order-matching paradigm. Automated market makers replace the order book with on-chain reserves, allowing asynchronous price discovery. The recently surging use of Ethereum-based liquidity pools speaks to the power of the model.\nNotwithstanding the success so far, there have been various drawbacks and concerns with the community liquidity solutions that have been employed. The highest profile problems have been cases where the smart contracts involved have errors in design or execution that were overlooked, leading to catastrophic loss for liquidity providers. But other large problems have emerged, including front-running, latency wars, gas price rigging and high transaction costs. Less noticed drawbacks include sub-optimal use of all available liquidity in a system",
