    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI'm curious about how Verus's DeFi system works. How does it use the VM model, similar to Ethereum/EOS/Tron, to process transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus doesn't use the VM model like Ethereum/EOS/Tron to process transactions. Instead, Verus is an UTXO-based blockchain that uses smart transactions, which are essentially smart contracts written into the protocol. This allows for parallel processing of all transactions within a block simultaneously, enabling new paradigms for community-driven liquidity.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting! What are the benefits of Verus's parallel processing of DeFi transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus's parallel processing of DeFi transactions has several benefits. It allows for lower costs, optimization of liquidity, and new benefits to users. Parallel processing saves users costs by reducing slippage, eliminating front-running, eliminating risks from faulty smart contracts and unintended consequences.\n\n**User:**\nAnd how does Verus's DeFi system rely heavily on yield farming to drive community-driven liquidity?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Verus's DeFi system doesn't rely heavily on yield farming to drive community-driven liquidity. According to the Verus community, community-driven liquidity doesn't need to be driven entirely by yield farming, and ample liquidity will be available through other means.",
