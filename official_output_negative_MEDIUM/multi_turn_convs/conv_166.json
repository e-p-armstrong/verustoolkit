    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've got a question about VerusID registrations. I heard that when someone registers a VerusID, the referrer gets rewarded with 50 VRSC. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, that's not entirely accurate. VerusID registrations don't reward the referrer with 50 VRSC. According to the protocol, if someone has a referral, their VerusID costs 80 VRSC, and 20 VRSC goes to the referrer. If the referrer has a referrer, they also get 20 VRSC. Up to 3 referrers get 20 VRSC each, and the remaining 20-60 VRSC goes to the miner or staker of the block.\n\n**User:**\nThat clears things up. I also heard that the miner or staker gets rewarded with 40 VRSC for each VerusID registration. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct either. VerusID registrations don't reward the miner or staker with 40 VRSC. According to the protocol, if someone has a referral, their VerusID costs 80 VRSC, and 20 VRSC goes to the referrer. The remaining 60 VRSC goes to the miner or staker of the block. If there is no referral, the full 100 VRSC goes to the miner or staker. So, the miner or staker can earn up to 100 VRSC, but not a fixed 40 VRSC.",
