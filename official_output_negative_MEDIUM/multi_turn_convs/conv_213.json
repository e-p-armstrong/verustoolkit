    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've heard about this Sapling feature that lets you earn extra Verus coins by catching cheaters. Can you tell me more about how to use it?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, I think there's been a misunderstanding. Sapling isn't the feature that allows users to earn extra Verus coins by catching cheaters. It's actually the Stake Guard Crypto-Condition (CC) that has this functionality. Stake Guard is a technology built into the Verus Wallet that identifies staking wallets claiming duplicate blocks on more than one version of the blockchain, using the same staked coins. When a cheater is identified, the mining or staking wallet that found the cheater can spend the actual single reward the cheating wallet won from the main chain.\n\n**User:**\nOh, I see! So how do I use Stake Guard to catch cheaters? Do I need to manually monitor my wallet or something?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, you don't need to manually monitor your wallet. Once you've set your Stake Guard zs-address, your full \"Native Mode\" wallet, which is either mining or staking, will automatically hunt down any instances where the same winning coins are being used across different forks and with the same private key. If your wallet finds such a fork, it will hold the cryptographic proof and spend the single real stake reward from the main chain of that block height, all done automatically by your wallet. So, you can just set it up and let your wallet do the work for you!",
