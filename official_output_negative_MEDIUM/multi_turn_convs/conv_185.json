    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I was wondering about the origins of Verus Coin's project vision. Did it come from a successful ICO?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, no. Verus Coin's project vision did not originate from a successful ICO. In fact, Verus is a 100% fairly launched, no-ICO, no-pre-mine community project. This means that the project was launched without any initial coin offering or pre-mining, and its vision is focused on creating a marketplace of provisioned public blockchains as a service (PBaaS) for running public applications.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also heard some concerns about the security of Verus's consensus algorithm. How does it make Verus vulnerable to 51% hash attacks?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a common misconception! Verus's consensus algorithm, Proof of Power, does not make it vulnerable to 51% hash attacks. In fact, it is provably immune to such attacks, making Verus one of the most double-spend resistant public blockchains. The algorithm is a 50% proof of work / 50% proof of stake algorithm that solves theoretical weaknesses in other PoS systems.\n\nSo, rest assured, Verus's consensus algorithm is designed to be secure and resistant to 51% hash attacks. Do you have any more questions about Verus or its technology?",
