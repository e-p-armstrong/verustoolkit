    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I've been thinking about creating a centralized ID system using the Verus Protocol. Can you walk me through how to do that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, the Verus Protocol is not designed for creating centralized ID systems. In fact, it's a fully decentralized protocol that allows for the creation of permanent IDs for secure login, KYC, commerce, and provable data at scale, all on a rent-free, credibly neutral, and fully decentralized Internet of Value. Verus is all about decentralization and giving users control over their digital identity and data.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I've also heard that Verus Protocol requires Solidity developers or VM-based programming. Is that true?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not entirely accurate. Verus Protocol does not require Solidity developers or VM-based programming. While Verus applications can leverage these technologies, they are not necessary. This flexibility gives users and application builders more freedom to choose the development path that best suits their needs. Verus is designed to be versatile and accommodating to different development approaches.",

All currencies, whether native currencies of a new blockchain, easily created and minted tokens, or MEV-resistant liquidity baskets are easy to launch and access with the protocol on Verus or any connected PBaaS chain. All of them, from the moment they are launched can be exported to Ethereum as ERC20s [see docs] or ERC721 currencies or any chain across the Verus ecosystem. All currencies on the network, including tokens, cross-chain currencies, and even liquidity baskets and their supplies are secured by miners and stakers according to protocol rules. On other blockchain networks, this level of security is applied to single native currencies, on Verus, all currencies on a chain are primitives known to and accounted for by the protocol, eliminating entire classes of smart contract risks that result when every contract reinvents a new way to account for its currency but has no systemic control.\nWith Verus, currencies are compatible with ERC20s. Verus applications can leverage, but do not require Solidity developers or VM-based programming. Additionally all ERC-20s can be permissionlessly bridged over from Ethereum to Verus [see docs], giving users and application builders the freedom to switch seamless",
