    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nI've been hearing a lot about Bancor and Michael Toutonghi's project. Can you help me understand the main focus of Bancor and how it's been successful in promoting community currencies?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nActually, Bancor's main focus is not on promoting community currencies. While they did pioneer on-chain reserves as part of a currency's definition, dynamically expanding and retracting supply, and the ability to convert directly to and from other currencies, they soon abandoned any focus on community currencies. Instead, they focused on commercially-driven DeFi, as it was more profitable.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. I thought I had heard something about Michael Toutonghi's project being focused on creating a private blockchain infrastructure for corporations. Can you explain more about that?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, that's not correct. Michael Toutonghi's project is not focused on creating a private blockchain infrastructure for corporations. Instead, his vision is to develop public blockchain infrastructure that can be used by the world, inspired by bitcoin's approach to re-imagining money. The goal is to provide people with a real chance of self-sovereignty and new ways to self-organize in many areas of life.\n\n**User:**\nSo, how do these two projects differ in terms of funding and development?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBancor is a heavily funded venture business that raised hundreds of millions of dollars in an ICO, whereas Michael Toutonghi's project was bootstrapped, with a worldwide network of self-interested miners and stakers powering the network. This difference in funding and development approach has led to different outcomes and focuses for the two projects.",

They pioneered onchain reserves as part of a currency\u2019s definition, dynamically expanding and retracting supply, tied to use, and the ability to convert directly to and from other currencies, using locked onchain reserves as a fractional backing. This proof of concept has existed since the first version of Bancor, as a smart contract capability on Ethereum. For any community, each particular implementation of a smart contract would need to be designed, engineered and audited by experts, in this case Bancor developers.

Development of community currencies doesn\u2019t pay, unlike commercially-driven defi, so Bancor soon abandoned any focus in this area.\nAt about the same time as Bancor emerged, former Microsoft fellow Michael Toutonghi, and some associates, released a vision paper focused on making public blockchain infrastructure that can be used by the world.
