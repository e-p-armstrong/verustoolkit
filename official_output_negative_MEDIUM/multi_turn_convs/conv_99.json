    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in creating a currency on Verus. How do I launch a currency on Verus without a namespace?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nI'm happy to help! Unfortunately, it's not possible to launch a currency on Verus without a namespace. A namespace is required, and that namespace is a VerusID. The namespace is the name of the currency (e.g. MyBrand@). You'll need to create a VerusID to serve as the namespace for your currency. Do you have any other questions about launching a currency on Verus?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. Is it possible to launch a currency on Verus for free?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, it's not possible to launch a currency on Verus for free. The launch of a currency on Verus costs 200 VRSC, and the registration of a VerusID (namespace) costs between 20 and 100 VRSC. These costs are always paid in the chain's native coin (to the worldwide miners and stakers). It's a small investment to get your currency up and running on the Verus network.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. What about subIDs? Can anyone create subIDs for a currency on Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, not anyone can create subIDs for a currency on Verus. Only the controlling VerusID (the namespace of the currency, the rootID) can create subIDs, if option 2 is chosen when defining the currency. This ensures that the creator of the currency has control over the creation of subIDs and can manage their currency effectively.",
