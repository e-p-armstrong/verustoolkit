    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**User:**\nHey, I'm interested in launching a currency on Verus. Can you tell me, when defining a currency on Verus, do the costs of launching the currency go to a central authority?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, the costs of launching a currency on Verus do not go to a central authority. Instead, they go to the miners and stakers of the blockchain, which is a decentralized process. This is one of the benefits of Verus - it's a decentralized platform that allows for community-driven development and maintenance.\n\n**User:**\nThat's great to hear! Another question I had was, to launch a currency on Verus, do you need to fund the VerusID with a large amount of a specific cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, to launch a currency on Verus, you need to fund VGG@ with 200+ VRSCTEST, which is a native cryptocurrency of the Verus blockchain, not Bitcoin. This allows you to create a currency that is native to the Verus ecosystem and takes advantage of its features and benefits.\n\n**User:**\nI see. And finally, when defining a currency on Verus, is it only possible to launch it as a simple token?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNo, when defining a currency on Verus, it's not limited to launching it as a simple token. There are many options and specifications available, such as launching it as a fractional reserve currency, multi-reserve basket, and more. Verus provides a lot of flexibility and customization options, allowing you to create a currency that meets your specific needs and goals. Does that answer your questions about launching a currency on Verus?",
