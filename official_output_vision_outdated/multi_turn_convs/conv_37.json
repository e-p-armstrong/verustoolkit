    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you understand more about Verus and its technology. What would you like to know?\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about the autochain and I'm curious about how nodes can improve their reputation for selection in future lotteries.\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNodes on the autochain can improve their reputation by consistently offering better Quality of Service (QoS). This is achieved by advertising autochain node support on the main blockchain, along with a stable payment address via a transaction, and then being selected in a random lottery. The Eigentrust ratings of all nodes are recorded by other nodes that serve the chain at regular intervals, and nodes with better ratings will be more likely to be selected in the next node lottery.\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any further questions about the autochain or node reputation?\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. What happens to nodes that get poorly rated on the autochain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nNodes that get poorly rated on the autochain will still share in the node rewards for the current blockchain. However, they will be less likely to be selected in the next node lottery. This incentivizes nodes to maintain a high level of service and reputation.\n\nDo you have any more questions about node ratings or the autochain?\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about the distributed consensus system in Verus, and I was wondering, what's the basis of trust in this system?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe basis of trust in the distributed consensus system is not based on belief in any individual human's behavior, but rather on the tendency of humans to act in their own self-interest. This is similar to the concept introduced by the Bitcoin proof of work implementation. It's a clever way to align incentives and create a trustworthy system without relying on a central authority.\n\nDo you have any more questions about the distributed consensus system or trust in Verus?",
