    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you understand Verus and its benefits. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been reading about machine learning and its applications. What advantage does Verus have over other systems when it comes to machine learning on human data?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus has an innate privacy advantage when it comes to machine learning on human data. It provides privacy to those whose data is used for learning, and by default, makes all resulting information public unless those making polls pay the Verus community a going rate to keep the data for themselves. This is a significant advantage over other systems, where user data is often exploited for profit without their knowledge or consent.\n\n**User:**\nThat's interesting. What is the primary goal of most machine learning systems in today's society?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnfortunately, the primary goal of most machine learning systems in today's society is to match consumers with products they are likely to buy and/or manipulate them into an actual purchase, thus generating revenue. This can lead to a multitude of issues, including manipulation and exploitation of users.\n\n**User:**\nAnd what unintended negative consequences can arise from machine learning algorithms disregarding their predictive abilities' effects on society?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nUnintended negative consequences can arise when machine learning algorithms disregard their predictive abilities' effects on society. For example, if an algorithm recognizes that people with depressive episodes are more likely to gamble, it may advertise airline tickets to gambling-oriented locations to those people, potentially exacerbating their situation. This is just one example, but the potential negative consequences are vast and varied.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really concerning. How does the Verus system limit the potential negative consequences of machine learning algorithms?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn the Verus system, machine learning algorithms are limited to accessing only the data that users permit, and are unable to easily target specific individuals. This helps prevent unintended negative consequences, such as those mentioned earlier, by ensuring that the algorithms are not able to exploit or manipulate individuals based on their personal data. By giving users control over their data and limiting the access of algorithms, Verus provides a safer and more responsible environment for machine learning.",
