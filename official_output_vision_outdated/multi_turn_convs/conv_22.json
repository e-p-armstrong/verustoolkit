    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help you with any questions you may have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm trying to understand more about autochains in Verus. What is their purpose, and how do they improve security and scalability?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nAutochains in Verus dynamically create parallel voting chains on demand for each poll in the ecosystem. This approach improves security by isolating each poll, and allows for virtually unlimited scaling. By isolating each poll, autochains prevent a single poll from affecting the entire network, making the system more secure and resilient.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. How does the Verus wallet contribute to the voting process, and what benefits do voters receive?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus wallet is used for voting and also has the ability to validate blocks through proof-of-stake. When enabled, voters who validate the election can earn rewards, which are paid in Virtue for intrinsic polls or from the payment transaction that instantiated the poll. This incentivizes users to participate in the voting process and helps to secure the network.\n\n**User:**\nWhat happens to the voting chain once a poll is complete?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nOnce a poll is complete, the results are posted back to the main Verus chain, and the chain used to run the poll can then be archived or deleted, and is typically abandoned. This allows the network to efficiently manage resources and focus on new polls and transactions.\n\n**User:**\nI've heard that blockchains aren't ideal for storing large amounts of data. Can you explain why that is, and what alternative solutions are being explored for distributed storage in Verus?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nBlockchains are not ideal for storing large amounts of data due to the massive duplication across the distributed network. This can lead to scalability issues and increased storage requirements. Instead, Verus is exploring alternative solutions such as the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and Open DHT, which are peer-to-peer file systems based on distributed hash tables. These solutions are more efficient for storing and retrieving large amounts of data.\n\n**User:**\nWhat is the key requirement for the Verus network in terms of distributed storage, and how do IPFS and Open DHT compare in meeting this requirement?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe key requirement for the Verus network is that mobile devices should be able to participate in its operation. While IPFS does not yet seem to have much support for mobile devices, Open DHT is an efficient C++ library intended for use with small devices, making it a more suitable solution for Verus. Open DHT's design and efficiency make it a better fit for the Verus network's requirements.",
