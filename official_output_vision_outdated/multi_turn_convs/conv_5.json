    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to help with any questions you may have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been hearing about intrinsic polls on the Verus network. What's the purpose of those?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe intrinsic polls will be used to classify content and perform basic, human verification functions on the Verus network. By participating in these polls, users will help the system rate and classify content across Verus applications, enabling a rating system rather than censorship. Does that make sense? Do you have any further questions about intrinsic polls?\n\n**User:**\nYeah, I was wondering, how will the participants of the intrinsic polls be selected?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe participants of the intrinsic polls will be selected based on a statistical lottery, weighted by their actual measure of Virtue. This way, participants are chosen in a fair and decentralized manner. Do you have any other questions about the poll participants or the polling process?\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've also heard that miners can provision autochains for polls. What's the benefit for miners who provision autochains for polls that are not commissioned?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nMiners who provision autochains for these polls will receive the same rewards as miners setting up autochains for commissioned polls. This incentivizes miners to support the network and provide the necessary infrastructure for the polls, even if they're not specifically commissioned. Does that answer your question?\n\n**User:**\nOne more question. Where does the content for intrinsic polls come from?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe content for these intrinsic polls will be taken from other polls and used to classify and rate those polls for easier discoverability and a better user experience of poll services. This creates a self-sustaining system where polls are rated and classified by the community, making it easier for users to find relevant and trustworthy polls. Do you have any more questions about intrinsic polls or Verus in general?",
