    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI was reading the Verus Project paper and I'm curious about some statements I found there. What kind of statements can be found in the Verus Project paper about its goals and plans?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe Verus Project paper includes forward-looking statements, which are predictions, statements of intent, discussion of plans, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. These statements give you an idea of what the project is aiming to achieve and how it plans to get there.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. But what should I be cautious about when considering these forward-looking statements about the Verus Project's development?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThat's a great question! You should be cautious not to place undue reliance, especially in any financial decision, on these forward-looking statements, as they are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results of the Verus Project's development to differ materially. In other words, don't take these statements as guarantees, and be aware that things might not turn out exactly as planned.\n\n**User:**\nGot it. Can the Verus Core developers modify or update these forward-looking statements in the future?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nYes, the Verus Core developers can modify, update, or change these forward-looking statements for legitimate reasons both within or beyond their control. They are not obligated to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. So, it's possible that these statements might change as the project evolves.\n\n**User:**\nThat's helpful to know. What is the intention of the Verus Core developers regarding the use of the Verus blockchain?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThe intention of the Verus Core developers is to use the Verus blockchain as an open-source development platform, contributing these technologies under permissive licensing for the betterment of society, rather than focusing solely on profit. They want to create a platform that benefits everyone, not just a select few.",
