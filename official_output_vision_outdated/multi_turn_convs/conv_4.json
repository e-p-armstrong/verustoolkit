    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help with any questions you have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm curious about content classification. What's the key distinction to consider when classifying content, especially when dealing with challenging classifications?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nWhen classifying content, it's essential to distinguish between fact and opinion. This distinction is crucial to ensure that classifications are accurate and objective. This fundamental difference helps to separate verifiable information from subjective viewpoints.\n\n**User:**\nThat makes sense. I've heard about Verus polls and how they're designed to support the discovery of accepted truths, facts, and credible emerging arguments. Can you explain how they achieve this?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus polls aim to support the discovery of accepted truths, facts, and credible emerging arguments by allowing voters to stake and earn or lose Verus (and later Virtue) by answering in a manner that matches consensus. This approach encourages voters to provide objective and factual answers. By aligning incentives with accuracy, Verus polls promote the emergence of reliable information.\n\n**User:**\nI understand. But what about Verus polls that are recognized as opinion polls? How do they work?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nIn Verus polls that are recognized as opinion polls, all answers are considered equally valid contributions. This approach acknowledges that opinions are subjective and respects the diversity of viewpoints. By embracing the complexity of opinions, Verus polls provide a platform for open discussion and exploration of different perspectives.",
