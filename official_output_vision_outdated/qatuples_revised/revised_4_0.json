    "What are the main goals of Phase Three in the development of Verus?",
    "In Phase Three, the main goals are to improve the mobile experiences, implement the identity system, and support strong, decentralized identity and attestations. This includes separating photo IDs and other photo content into components that can be separately verified in unbiased human polls, as well as supporting optional KYC strong identities through notarization of identities and poll-based identity verification. Additionally, this phase will be the first to support Verus chain validation PoV enhanced PoS.",
    "In phase three, we plan to further improve the mobile experiences, implement the identity system, including support for strong, decentralized identity and attestations, separating\nphoto IDs and other photo content into components that can be separately verified in unbiased human polls. At this point, we intend to support optional KYC strong identities, via\nboth notarization of identities as well as poll-based identity verification. This will also be\nthe first phase that supports Verus chain validation PoV enhanced PoS.4.4Phase Four \u2013 Integrated Machine Learning, Content, StorageIn phase four, Verus will begin to truly leverage the foundation built in phases one, two, and\nthree by focusing on broad content classification capabilities for off-chain content, improving storage management support in its distributed hash table implementations, supporting\nstorage monetization in some way, and providing open source, public implementations of\nmachine learning systems that can learn from data on the Verus network to solve real world\nchallenges of today and tomorrow.225Forward Looking Statements",
