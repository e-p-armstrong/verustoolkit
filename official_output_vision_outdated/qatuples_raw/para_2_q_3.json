    "What potential benefits do fully peer-to-peer, public blockchains offer for economic systems and societies?",
    "Fully peer-to-peer, public blockchains have the potential to revitalize economic systems and societies, creating a more equitable and honest economic framework for all. By disintermediating traditional systems, these blockchains offer tools that can promote greater fairness and transparency in economic transactions.",
    "Preface\nHuman progress leapt forward with the invention of money. Money enabled worldwide,\ntrade-based economies to move from a primitive, barter-based system to a consensus-based\nvaluation and accounting of verifiable, storable, divisible, and scarce commodities as early\ncurrencies of exchange.\nEven in recent times, actual or perceived scarcity and authenticity of source, whether\ngenuine gold, an original giant coin of Micronesia [27] \u2013 or government backed notes with\ntrusted fiscal management and the ability to exchange for oil \u2013 provide the foundation of\nvalue upon which, ultimately, human resources are bought and sold.\nWhat blockchain does is straightforward. It enables the creation of cryptographic tools\nand applications that do nothing less than provide us with a new future of programmable\nmoney. This programmable money integrates directly with existent accounting functions\nand, eventually, with all automated services. Blockchain technologies provide humans with\na new, verifiable solution to ensure scarcity, authenticity of source, inbuilt transferability,\nfungibility through privacy, and programmable rules. More than that, fully peer to peer,\npublic blockchains disintermediate and provide tools that offer the opportunity to revitalize our economic systems and societies, potentially creating a more equitable and honest\neconomic framework for all.",
