    "What is the significance of the layered security approach used by Verus autochains?",
    "The layered security approach used by Verus autochains makes it extremely difficult for a 51% attack to occur, as it would require a significant amount of hash power and coordination across multiple layers of security. This makes Verus autochains highly secure and resistant to attacks.",
    "\u2022\n\n4\n\n\u2022 Secure \u2014 Our novel autochains \u2013 dynamic, security isolated, proof-of-stake (PoS)\nblockchains \u2013 are layered over proof-of-work (PoW) and delayed proof-of-work (dPoW)\nsecurity, all the way back to the real Bitcoin blockchain through Komodo.\nBy default, the first layer of security is run by the actual voters, themselves. Together,\nthis provides unprecedented layered security both in the autochain and in delayed\nproof-of-work, leveraging the network with the most hash power in the world.\nWe like to think that \u2013 on a Verus autochain \u2013 a 51% attack is called winning a poll.\n\u2022 Scalable \u2014 Each poll is conducted on its own, automatically-created-and-validated\nblockchain, operating under its own visible validation rules.\n\n2\n\nOur Vision for Verus Foundational Applications\n\nThroughout history, understanding what a population truly thinks or feels has been an\ninvaluable capability. The manipulation of that understanding can, and has, repeatedly\nchanged the course of history.\nThe Verus Project plans to use highly decentralized blockchain technology to enable all\npeople to safely, anonymously, and confidently express their opinions \u2013 on any issue. Verus\nusers will be able to share their knowledge in a public forum, query a population of humans\n(or eventually both AIs and humans), quickly and effectively, and \u2013 importantly \u2013 earn\ncryptocurrency in exchange for these contributions to collective knowledge.\nA primary goal of the Verus Project is to enable societies and organizations to make\ndecisions based on a more honest understanding of the public\u2019s actual beliefs. To achieve\nthis goal, we co",
