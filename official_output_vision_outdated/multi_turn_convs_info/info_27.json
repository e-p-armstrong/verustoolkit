            "The invention of money enabled worldwide trade-based economies to transition from a primitive, barter-based system to a consensus-based valuation and accounting of verifiable, storable, divisible, and scarce commodities as early currencies of exchange.",
            "Preface\nHuman progress leapt forward with the invention of money. Money enabled worldwide,\ntrade-based economies to move from a primitive, barter-based system to a consensus-based\nvaluation and accounting of verifiable, storable, divisible, and scarce commodities as early\ncurrencies of exchange.\nEven in recent times, actual or perceived scarcity and authenticity of source, whether\ngenuine gold, an original giant coin of Micronesia [27] \u2013 or government backed notes with\ntrusted fiscal management and the ability to exchange for oil \u2013 provide the foundation of\nvalue upon which, ultimately, human resources are bought and sold.\nWhat blockchain does is straightforward. It enables the creation of cryptographic tools\nand applications that do nothing less than provide us with a new future of programmable\nmoney. This programmable money integrates directly with existent accounting functions\nand, eventually, with all automated services.

            "The key factors that provide the foundation of value for currencies include actual or perceived scarcity, authenticity of source, and trusted fiscal management. For example, genuine gold, government-backed notes, and the ability to exchange for oil have all been used to establish value.",
