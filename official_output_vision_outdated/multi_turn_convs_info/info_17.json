            "What is the relationship between identities in Verus, and how can their owners verify information about them?",
            "In Verus, each identity has its own unique address. Unless the owner reveals information linking two or more identities, it is cryptographically hard (virtually impossible) to correlate one identity to another. However, the owner of an identity can cryptographically verify statements made about identities under their control, attesting to identity properties (such as passport, age, height, citizenship, photo, etc.) with the strongest verification possible using today's digital technology.",

            "The goal of Verus is to support fully decentralized verification of identities that can provide strong verification, similar to today's centralized systems. To achieve this, Verus plans to enable compatibility with centralized forms of identity and allow people to optionally support Know-Your-Customer (KYC) in identities.
