            "In Phase Three, the main goals are to improve the mobile experiences, implement the identity system, and support strong, decentralized identity and attestations. This includes separating photo IDs and other photo content into components that can be separately verified in unbiased human polls, as well as supporting optional KYC strong identities through notarization of identities and poll-based identity verification. Additionally, this phase will be the first to support Verus chain validation PoV enhanced PoS.",
