**AI Assistant:**
Hello! I'm here to help with any questions you might have about Verus. Please, ask me anything!

**User:**
Yeah, so I've run into some errors and I'm not sure what's causing them. Do you know what causes the errors:
```
error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory
error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory
```
When running `./verusd` on a Linux distro?

**AI Assistant:**
Great question! These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.

`./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command such as `sudo apt-get install`. Do you have any further questions about these errors?

**User:**
Yes, actually. If you run `./verusd` and encounter the errors I mentioned earlier, how do you solve them?

**AI Assistant:**
Good question! In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:

1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time. Did this solve your problem?"""
