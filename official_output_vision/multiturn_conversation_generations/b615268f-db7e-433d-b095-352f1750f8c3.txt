    What causes the errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    When I run `./verusd` on a Linux distro?


    **ANSWER:**

    These errors may be caused by required dependencies for `./verusd` not being installed
    by default on a Linux distribution. The lack of required dependencies results
    in the error messages when you try to run `./verusd`.


    `./verusd` uses the libraries `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` so your system must either
    have them installed by default, or you must install them manually using a command
    such as `sudo apt-get install`.


    **QUESTION:**

    If I run `./verusd` and encounter these errors:

    ```

    error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory

    error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    ```

    How can I solve them?


    **ANSWER:**

    In order to solve these errors, which are likely caused by dependencies not being
    installed by default on a Linux distro, try the following:


    1. **Install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libaries.** This can be accomplished by
    running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.


    2. **Try running the command `./verusd` again.** You can see if installing the
    dependencies worked by running `./verusd` a second time.'

- content: "**QUESTION:**\nWhat are VerusIDs?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs are a fully-functional\
    \ blockchain protocol. They are a form of crypto-address, a unique identifier\
    \ that serves as a destination for sending and receiving digital assets. Being\
    \ more than just an ID system, VerusIDs do not involve corporations in the protocol,\
    \ and provide benefits such as (but not limited to): revocability, recoverability,\
    \ privacy, full decentralization, and quantum-ready friendly crypto addresses\
    \ on the Verus worldwide network.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat does \"quantum-ready\
    \ friendly crypto-addresses\" mean, in the context of Verus and VerusIDs?\n\n\
    **ANSWER:**\nThe phrase \"quantum-ready friendly crypto-addresses,\" in the context\
    \ of Verus and VerusIDs, refers to the resistance of VerusIDs against attack by\
    \ quantum computers that use existing algorithms. Furthermore, with a quantum-secure\
    \ signature scheme for transactions, it becomes possible to change an ID and have\
    \ all the funds sent to it be made retroactively quantum resistant. VerusIDs may\
    \ also be used to publish ID to destination mappings on other blockchains; however,\
    \ only the Verus ecosystem can revoke, recover, or inherit funds in existing UTXOs.\n\
    \nThe basic idea is that quantum computers, once invented, have the potential\
    \ to break many cryptographic algorithms used to secure digital assets. Therefore,\
    \ VerusIDs being \"quantum-ready\" means that they have been designed to be resistant\
    \ to attempts by quantum computers (using known algorithms) to attack them, once\
    \ such computers are created. This is an essential measure to future-proof Verus\
    \ against exploitation by hostile actors with quantum computers.\n\n**QUESTION:**\n\
    What does it mean for VerusIDs to be a fully decentralized protocol?\n\n**ANSWER:**\n\
    A number of factors make VerusIDs fully decentralized. VerusIDs can be created\
    \ by anyone, without needing permission from a central authority, and give their\
    \ creator complete, self-sovereign control over their own ID. The costs incurred\
    \ creating an ID go to miners, stakers, and ID referrers \u2014 essentially, the\
    \ community members who help maintain Verus \u2014 rather than single entity like\
    \ a corporation or government. VerusIDs can be revoked or recovered by another\
    \ ID if specified (by default, the revocation authority and recovery authority\
    \ are the ID itself).\n\nEssentially, VerusIDs being fully decentralized means\
    \ that neither their creation, usage, or recovery/revocation need to be managed\
    \ or approved by a central authority \u2014 the community supports the transaction.\
    \ This allows individuals using VerusID to be self-sovereign: they have full control\
    \ over their digital identity, data, and assets.\n\n**QUESTION:**\nWhat do VerusIDs\
    \ offer me in terms of privacy and power?\n\n**ANSWER:**\nVerusIDs offer many\
    \ advantages, and are both private and powerful. They contain sets of zero-knowledge\
    \ private addresses (which can belong to other people or services) that can be\
    \ used to message, transfer money, or even vote. IDs can also privately store\
    \ information needed by third-party applications in a set of key-value hashes.\
    \ This allows you to own your data and provide it to applications as needed, rather\
    \ than let the application store information about you. Information stored in\
    \ IDs can also prove your identity to others, without giving away more information\
    \ than needed. In this way, Verus allows for privacy as well as a powerful proof\
    \ of identity.\n\nVerusIDs are also notable in that multiple addresses or other\
    \ IDs can be defined as primary addresses. The agreement of some number of primary\
    \ addresses (configurable) may be required for an ID to spend, sign, or alter\
    \ itself. Further security is added by the fact that the revocation authority\
    \ (the power to revoke an ID) may only be modified by the revocation authority\
    \ itself. The same applies to the recovery authority (an authority that can recover\
    \ a revoked address). Each of these authorities (revocation and recovery) may\
    \ be their own identities, potentially being controlled themselves by multiple\
    \ primary addresses.\n\nIn short, VerusIDs are private with your information,\
    \ and configurable with who controls them and what consensus is required to change\
    \ them."

- content: '**QUESTION:**

    What is the main concept behind the Bitcoin proof of work implementation, and
    how does it establish trust?


    **ANSWER:**

    The main concept behind the Bitcoin proof of work implementation is that it establishes
    trust not due to belief in any individual human''s behavior, but based on the
    tendency of humans to act in their own self-interest. It rewards miners in statistical
    proportion to the computing power they employ to mine for Bitcoin, which in turn
    ensures that the network is secure and trustworthy.



    **QUESTION:**

    How does the mining competition in Bitcoin work, and what is the purpose of it?


    **ANSWER:**

    In Bitcoin, miners compete to solve a statistical mathematical puzzle specific
    to each block. The winner of each competition earns the right to accurately process
    the next block of pending Bitcoin transactions and claim a specific measure of
    Bitcoin, called the "block reward", plus fees of all transactions in the block
    that was processed. The mining competition serves to determine the amount of computing
    power a would-be attacker would have to control in order to mine blocks that were
    not earned according to the intended rules, execute transactions that might otherwise
    be rejected, and prevent certain transactions from executing altogether.



    **QUESTION:**

    What is the significance of controlling more than 50% of the total power of all
    miners in Bitcoin, and what would it enable an attacker to do?


    **ANSWER:**

    Controlling more than 50% of the total power of all miners in Bitcoin would enable
    an attacker to forge a false Bitcoin chain, execute transactions that might otherwise
    be rejected, and prevent certain transactions from executing altogether. However,
    currently, it is likely infeasible for any single actor to mount such an attack
    against Bitcoin, making the network secure.



    **QUESTION:**

    What are some of the benefits of the proof-of-work (PoW) system, and what kind
    of value does it manage?


    **ANSWER:**

    The proof-of-work (PoW) system enables secure management of large sums of money,
    sends transactions of that value to anyone, anywhere, at any time, and does this
    all without any company, bank, or trusted third party, of any kind. Currently,
    PoW manages hundreds of billions of dollars of value.

    I''m trying to learn more about the underlying concepts of blockchain. What is
    the main concept behind the Bitcoin proof of work implementation, and how does

    **AI Assistant:**

    The main concept behind the Bitcoin proof of work implementation is that it establishes
    trust not due to belief in any individual human''s behavior, but based on the
    tendency of humans to act in their own self-interest. It rewards miners in statistical
    proportion to the computing power they employ to mine for Bitcoin, which in turn
    ensures that the network is secure and trustworthy. This mechanism allows for
    a decentralized and trustless system, where trust is established through mathematical
    certainty rather than relying on a central authority. Would you like to know more
    about how this works?


    **User:**

    Actually, yes. How does the mining competition in Bitcoin work, and what is the
    purpose of it?


    **AI Assistant:**

    power a would-be attacker would have to control in order to mine blocks that were
    not earned according to the intended rules, execute transactions that might otherwise
    be rejected, and prevent certain transactions from executing altogether. This
    competition incentivizes miners to act honestly and maintain the integrity of
    the blockchain.


    **User:**

    That makes sense. What is the significance of controlling more than 50% of the
    total power of all miners in Bitcoin, and what would it enable an attacker to
    do?


    **AI Assistant:**

    Controlling more than 50% of the total power of all miners in Bitcoin would enable
    an attacker to forge a false Bitcoin chain, execute transactions that might otherwise
    be rejected, and prevent certain transactions from executing altogether. However,
    currently, it is likely infeasible for any single actor to mount such an attack
    against Bitcoin, making the network secure. This is because the collective mining
    power of the network is so vast that it would require an enormous amount of resources
    to overcome.


    **User:**

    Okay, got it. What are some of the benefits of the proof-of-work (PoW) system,
    and what kind of value does it manage?


    **AI Assistant:**

    The proof-of-work (PoW) system enables secure management of large sums of money,
    sends transactions of that value to anyone, anywhere, at any time, and does this
    all without any company, bank, or trusted third party, of any kind. Currently,
    PoW manages hundreds of billions of dollars of value. The benefits of PoW include
