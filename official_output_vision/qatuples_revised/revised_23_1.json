    "How do identities with Virtue participate in the intrinsic polls, and what is the benefit of doing so?",
    "Identities with Virtue can participate in the intrinsic polls based on a statistical lottery and weighted by their actual measure of Virtue. By participating in these polls, they help the system classify and rate content, and in return, they can set preferences for the ratings of polls they may wish to see.",
    "Once Virtue is activated, the Verus network itself will run specific, intrinsic polls that will\nbe regularly available to identities with Virtue, based on a statistical lottery and weighted\nby their actual measure of Virtue. Participating in these polls, which will be used to classify\ncontent and perform basic, human verification functions, enables participants to help the\nsystem classify and rate content across Verus applications, enabling a rating system rather\nthan censorship to allow each voter to set preferences for the ratings of polls they may wish\nto see.\nMiners who provision autochains for these intrinsic polls will get the same rewards as\nminers setting up autochains for commissioned polls. The content for these polls will be taken\nfrom other polls and will be used to classify and rate those polls for easier discoverability\nand the user experience of poll services.143.3.6Privacy",
