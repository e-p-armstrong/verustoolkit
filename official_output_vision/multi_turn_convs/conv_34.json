    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHi there! I'm here to help answer any questions you may have about Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI've been thinking about blockchain and privacy. What's a common misconception about privacy on the blockchain, specifically with regards to Bitcoin transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nA common misconception is that Bitcoin transactions are private, when in fact all Bitcoin transactions, as well as the public addresses between which value is transferred, are public information. This is an important distinction to make, as many people assume that Bitcoin transactions are private just because they use a pseudonym.\n\n**User:**\nThat's good to know. I've also been looking into the Verus blockchain, and I was wondering how poll autochains on the Verus blockchain ensure the privacy of votes?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nPoll autochains on the Verus blockchain support zk-SNARKs, which ensure that votes that have not been disclosed by a voter remain provably anonymous to all other parties, while still being verifiable by the person who holds the keys to the address that cast them. This is a powerful tool for ensuring the privacy of votes in a decentralized system.\n\n**User:**\nThat sounds really interesting. But I've also heard that zk-SNARKs can be resource-intensive. Can mobile phones currently generate zk-SNARK transactions?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nCurrently, mobile phones cannot generate zk-SNARK transactions due to the memory requirements of zk-SNARK transactions and standard smartphone hardware specifications. However, upcoming releases of new Zcash technology are expected to make z-transactions more efficient while maintaining the same privacy guarantees. Once these technologies are available, they will be supported on the Verus chain, enabling z-transactions and all Verus features on mobile devices. So while it's not possible today, it's something we're working towards in the future.",
