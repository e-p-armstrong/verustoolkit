    "## Conversation that answers the provided questions:\n**AI Assistant:**\nHey there! I'm here to assist you in understanding Verus. What's on your mind today?\n\n**User:**\nI'm reading through the Verus vision paper and I have some questions. What kind of system does Verus aim to create, and what problems does it aim to solve?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nVerus aims to create a system that is truly confidential, verifiable, and transparent. One of the problems it aims to solve is ensuring the integrity of decision-making processes, such as elections, to prevent external influences from deciding the state of world politics.\n\n**User:**\nThat's really interesting. I'm still going through the vision paper, and I'm on the section about polls. What specific aspect of Verus is being discussed in this section?\n\n**AI Assistant:**\nThis section of the vision paper is discussing the running, recording, and scaling of polls using transient, proof-of-stake (PoS) chains. It's exploring how Verus can enable secure, transparent, and scalable polling systems.",
