    "How do nodes on the autochain build reputation and increase their chances of being selected in future lotteries?",
    "Nodes on the autochain can build reputation and increase their chances of being selected in future lotteries by consistently offering better Quality of Service (QoS). This is achieved by advertising autochain node support on the main blockchain, along with a stable payment address via a transaction, and then being selected in a random lottery. The Eigentrust ratings of all nodes are recorded by other nodes that serve the chain at regular intervals, which helps to establish their reputation.",
